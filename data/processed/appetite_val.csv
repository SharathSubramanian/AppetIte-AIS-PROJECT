"Cambodian Grilled Chicken (Mann Oeng K'tem Sor, Marech)","1 whole chicken (3 1/2 to 4 pounds), 5 cloves garlic, peeled and cut in half, 2 tablespoons sugar, 1 teaspoon coarse salt (kosher or sea), 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon Asian fish sauce (or more soy sauce), 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, 1 clove garlic, peeled and gently crushed with the side of a cleaver, 2 teaspoons annatto seeds (achiote), or 2 teaspoons sweet paprika, 1 teaspoon coarse salt (kosher or sea), 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon sugar (optional), 2 limes, A grill basket (optional), 1 to 4 hours for marinating the chicken","Title: Cambodian Grilled Chicken (Mann Oeng K'tem Sor, Marech)
Instructions: 1. Prepare the chicken and marinade: Remove and discard the fat just inside the neck and body cavities of the chicken. Remove the package of giblets and set it aside for another use. Rinse the chicken, inside and out, under cold running water, then drain and blot it dry, inside and out, with paper towels. Spatchcock the chicken. Make 2 deep slashes to the bone in both sides of the chicken breast and in each leg and thigh. Trim or fold the wing tips back behind the wings. Place the bird in a nonreactive baking dish just large enough to hold it.
2. Place the garlic halves, sugar, and salt in a heavy mortar and pound to a paste with a pestle. Work in the soy sauce and fish sauce. If you do not have a mortar and pestle, combine the garlic, sugar, and salt in a small food processor and puree to a paste, then work in the soy sauce and fish sauce. Spoon the marinade over the chicken, forcing it into the slits and turning the bird to coat it well on both sides. Let the chicken marinate in the refrigerator, covered, for 1 hour to 4 hours; the longer it marinates, the richer the flavor will be.
3. Meanwhile, make the glaze: Heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the crushed clove of garlic and cook until just beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the garlic to a small heatproof bowl. Add the annatto seeds to the saucepan with the oil and cook until fragrant and browned and the oil turns orange, about 2 minutes. If you are using paprika instead of annatto seeds, cook it for only 15 seconds. Strain the oil through a fine-mesh wire strainer into the bowl with the garlic. Set the glaze aside.
4. Prepare the dipping sauce: Place 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper and 1/4 teaspoon of sugar, if using, in 2 small attractive bowls. Have the limes ready; you'll add the lime juice at the last minute. (See Note.)
5. Set up the grill for direct grilling and preheat it to medium. Leave one section of the grill bare for a safety zone.
6. When ready to cook, brush and oil the grill grate. Drain the chicken and discard the marinade and arrange it on the hot grate or in an oiled grill basket, if using, skin side down. Grill the chicken until it is golden brown and cooked through, 12 to 20 minutes per side. Move the chicken as needed to dodge any flare-ups. Use an instant-read meat thermometer to test for doneness, inserting it into the thickest part of a thigh but not so that it touches a bone. The internal temperature should be about 170°F. Alternatively, you can make a cut in the chicken meat where the thigh connects to the body; there should be no traces of red at the bone. During the last 10 minutes of cooking, start brushing the chicken on both sides with the glaze.
7. To serve, transfer the chicken, skin side up, to a platter. Let it rest for about 2 minutes, then cut it into pieces with a cleaver. Add 2 tablespoons of lime juice to each bowl with the salt, pepper, and sugar for the dipping sauce and stir it with a fork or chopsticks until the salt and sugar dissolves. To eat, dip the pieces of chicken in the salted lime juice.
Khmer Chicken Grilled Using the Indirect Method: You can also grill the chicken using the indirect method, a process that, although not traditionally Khmer, has the advantage of eliminating all risk of flare-ups. Set up the grill for indirect grilling, place a drip pan in the center, and preheat the grill to medium. Place the marinated chicken skin side up in the center of the grate over the drip pan and away from the heat. Cover the grill and cook the chicken until browned and cooked through, 40 minutes to 1 hour. Start brushing the chicken with the glaze during the last 15 minutes of cooking and baste it again every 5 minutes.",cambodian-grilled-chicken-em-mann-oeng-ktem-sor-marech-em-359049

Let chicken cool slightly, then pull skin from meat and transfer to a shallow bowl; cover and chill (save for making the gremolata).
Return pot to medium heat and cook shallots and garlic, cut side down, in the same pot, tossing shallots occasionally, until shallots are browned in spots and garlic is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add wine, stirring to release any bits stuck on the bottom of pot, and cook until reduced by two-thirds, about 2 minutes. Add parsley, bay leaves, reserved bacon, and 8 cups water, season generously with salt and pepper, and bring to a simmer. Return chicken thighs to pot and bring stew back up to a simmer. Cover with a lid, leaving slightly askew so steam can escape, and cook, adjusting heat to maintain a very gentle simmer and skimming foam from surface as needed, until meat is tender and easily pulls away from bones, 1–1 1/2 hours.
Transfer thighs to a cutting board and let cool 10–15 minutes; keep liquid at a simmer. Pull meat from bones and tear into bite-size pieces. Add bones back to pot as you go. Transfer meat to a medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Add kale and simmer until kale is tender and liquid is very flavorful, 25–30 minutes.
Remove stew from heat, add meat back to pot, and let cool uncovered (bones and all) until no longer steaming. Cover pot and chill stew at least 12 hours (you can skip this step, but it will dramatically improve the flavor).
Uncover stew and spoon off half to three-quarters of fat on the surface; discard. Gently reheat stew until barely simmering. Pluck out and discard bones, parsley, and bay leaves. Taste and season with more salt and pepper if needed. Ladle stew into bowls and top as desired.
Lemon oil can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before using. Stew can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.",slow-cooked-chicken-stew-with-kale

Instructions: Preheat oven to 250°F. Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt in a large bowl until foamy and the yellowish tinge has disappeared, about 2 minutes. With the motor running, add granulated sugar about 1 Tbsp. at a time until mixture is very stiff and shiny, about 5 minutes.
Transfer meringue to a piping bag fitted with a 1/2"" round pastry tip (or a freezer bag with a 1/2"" opening cut from one bottom corner). Pipe 12 mounds ranging in size from 1""–1 1/2"" in diameter for the mushroom caps on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Pipe 12 cones straight up about 1 1/2"" high for the mushroom stems. With a lightly damp finger, tamp down points on rounds. Sprinkle rounds with cocoa powder. Pipe extra tops and stems with remaining meringue as backups.
Bake meringues until dry and set, about 2 hours. Open oven door 10 minutes to release any steam. Turn oven off, shut door, and let meringues dry out completely, about 2 hours longer or up to overnight.
When ready to assemble, melt chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl in microwave, stirring every 10 seconds, until melted, about 20 seconds. Using an offset spatula, release meringues from parchment. Using a paring knife, make a small hole in the center of flat side of each mushroom cap. Spread some chocolate on flat side, then stick top of stem into hole. Return to parchment and repeat with remaining tops and stems. Let mushrooms stand at room temperature until chocolate is firm.
Combine pistachios and milk in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until pistachios are very tender, about 20 minutes. Remove and skim off any loose pistachio skins.
Meanwhile, sprinkle gelatin over 2 Tbsp. water in a small bowl and let stand 5 minutes.

Whisk egg whites, granulated sugar, and salt in a large heatproof bowl. Set bowl over a pot of simmering water (do not let bowl touch water) and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture becomes fluffy and opaque and you can’t feel any grains of sugar when you rub mixture between two fingers, about 5 minutes. Remove bowl from heat.
Melt chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl in microwave, stirring every 20 seconds, until melted, about 1 minute. Let cool slightly.
Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat egg white mixture until cool, glossy, and fluffy, about 10 minutes. (A stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment makes this job much easier!) Add butter one piece at a time, beating until fully incorporated before adding the next, until fluffy and smooth, another 4 minutes. If mixture looks curdled, switch to the paddle attachment and/or apply a little bit of heat to underside of bowl with a washcloth dipped in hot water and continue to beat until smooth. Beat in chocolate and vanilla extract until combined.
Do Ahead: Frosting can be made 3 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and chill. Bring to room temperature and beat to desired consistency.

Sift flour, baking powder, salt, and 1/4 tsp. cardamom over egg yolk mixture and fold gently to combine (it will be very thick).
Using electric mixer on high speed, beat egg whites and cream of tartar in another clean large bowl until foamy and the yellowish tinge has disappeared, about 1 minute. Beat in 1/2 cup granulated sugar, about 1 Tbsp. at a time, until shiny, medium stiff peaks form. Fold about one-quarter of egg white mixture into egg yolk mixture to loosen. Fold remaining egg white mixture into egg yolk mixture until combined.
Transfer batter to prepared pan; smooth top. Bake cake until puffed and set and springs back when gently poked in the center, 15–20 minutes. Transfer cake to a wire rack and let cool 5 minutes.
Set a clean dish towel on a work surface and dust completely with powdered sugar. Cut around edges of cake with a sharp paring knife. Invert cake onto prepared towel; remove parchment. Without squishing the cake and starting on long side, gently roll up cake in towel. Transfer cake to a wire rack and let cool completely.
While cake cools, make the brandy syrup. Cook remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar and 1/4 tsp. cardamom with 2 Tbsp. water in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in brandy. Let cool.
Melt chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl in microwave, stirring every 20 seconds, until melted, about 1 minute. Using an offset spatula, spread melted chocolate across a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Sift cocoa over and freeze bark until solid, about 10 minutes.
Gently unroll cake. With a pastry brush, evenly brush with brandy syrup until all syrup is absorbed. Spread filling evenly over cake and roll it back up without towel.
Transfer to a platter. Trim ends. Cut off about 3"" from both ends on a diagonal. Place angled side of each small piece against roll to create branches, positioning one on top and the other on the side, using a large dab of frosting to adhere. Cover any exposed cake on sides with more frosting.

Instructions: Blend flour, eggs, salt, and water in processor until mixture just begins to form a ball, adding more water, drop by drop, if dough is too dry (dough should be firm and not sticky). Process dough for 15 seconds more to knead it. Transfer to a floured surface and let stand, covered with an inverted bowl, 1 hour to let the gluten relax and make rolling easier.
Mound flour on a work surface, preferably wooden, and make a well in center. Add eggs, salt, and water to well. With a fork, gently beat eggs and water until combined. Gradually stir in enough flour to form a paste, pulling in flour closest to egg mixture and being careful not to make an opening in outer wall of well. Knead remaining flour into mixture with your hands to form a dough, adding more water, drop by drop, if dough is too dry (dough should be firm and not sticky). Knead dough until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Cover with an inverted bowl and let stand 1 hour (to make rolling easier).
Heat butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then sauté onion, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 6 minutes. Add artichoke hearts and sauté, stirring occasionally, until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly.
Transfer all but 3/4 cup artichoke mixture to cleaned bowl of processor (reserve remaining artichoke mixture in skillet), then add cheese, parsley, yolk, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and nutmeg and pulse until mixture is coarsely chopped.
Cut pasta dough into 4 pieces, then flatten each piece into a rough rectangle and cover rectangles with an inverted large bowl. Set rollers of pasta machine on widest setting.
Lightly dust 1 rectangle with flour and feed through rollers. (Keep remaining rectangles under bowl.) Fold rectangle in half and feed it, folded end first, through rollers 7 or 8 more times, folding it in half each time and feeding folded end through. Dust with flour if necessary to prevent sticking. Turn dial to next (narrower) setting and feed dough through rollers without folding. Continue to feed dough through rollers once at each setting, without folding, until you reach narrowest setting. Dough will be a smooth sheet (about 24 inches long and 4 inches wide).
Put sheet of dough on a floured work surface and drop 6 (1 1/2-teaspoon) mounds of filling 1 1/2 inches apart in a row down center of one half of sheet. Brush egg wash around each mound, then fold other half of sheet over filling. Press down firmly around each mound, forcing out air. (Air pockets increase the chance that ravioli will break during cooking.) Cut pasta (between mounds) with cutter into 3-inch rounds. Line a large shallow baking pan with a clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth) and dust towel with flour, then arrange ravioli in 1 layer in it. Make more ravioli with remaining pasta dough, 1 sheet at a time, and remaining filling, transferring ravioli to lined pan.
Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly butter baking dish.
Bring a 6- to 8-quart pot of salted water to a boil. Add ravioli, carefully stirring to separate, and, adjusting heat to keep water at a gentle boil, cook until pasta is just tender, about 6 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a colander.

Crispy Whole Wheat Graham Crackers,"3/4 cup (5 1/2 ounces) sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized), 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1 tablespoon vanilla extract, 1/4 cup (3 ounces) golden syrup, such as Lyle’s, sorghum, unsulfured molasses (not blackstrap), or honey, 1 1/2 sticks (6 ounces) unsalted butter, solid but creamy—about 70°F, 2 1/2 cups (12 ounces) whole wheat flour (not stone-ground or white whole wheat), plus more for dusting","Title: Crispy Whole Wheat Graham Crackers
Instructions: Combine sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, vanilla, golden syrup, and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed to moisten, then increase to medium and beat until somewhat light, about 3 minutes. Reduce speed to low, add whole wheat flour, and mix to form a soft dough.
Scrape dough onto a work surface and knead gently to form a ball. Divide in half. Use immediately or wrap in plastic and refrigerate for up to 1 week; soften for 30 minutes at room temperature, then knead on a bare work surface until pliable and smooth.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F. Generously flour a large sheet of parchment and place one portion of dough in the center. Pat into a 5-by-6-inch rectangle, sprinkle with flour, flip, and dust again. Working from the center out and adding more flour as needed, roll the dough until roughly 15-by-11 inches and very thin. Slide onto an aluminum baking sheet and brush away excess flour. Repeat with remaining dough.
For grocery store look-alikes, score each sheet of dough into twelve 2 1/4-by-4 3/4-inch rectangles and dock with a bamboo skewer or the narrow end of a chopstick (a strictly cosmetic procedure). Otherwise, leave the dough uncut.
Bake until crackers are tawny brown and firm, though your fingertip may leave a faint indentation, about 20 minutes. Immediately cut along the pre-scored lines with a knife, or cut into free-form shapes using a pizza wheel. Cool to room temperature directly on the baking sheets. Enjoy scrap pieces as a snack, or pulverize into crumbs. The grahams can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks at room temperature or frozen for up to 3 months.
Chocolate: My mom used to sandwich chocolate graham crackers with peanut butter for an after-school snack, a combo I re-create by reducing the whole wheat flour to 10 ounces (21/4 cups), sifted with 1 ounce (1/3 cup) natural or Dutch-process cocoa powder. To retain their deep cocoa color, roll the dough in sifted cocoa powder. Serve with generous smears of peanut butter and a tall glass of milk.
Cinnamon Sugar: We rarely had sugar-coated grahams in our pantry when I was a kid, but they were always at my best friend’s house, and seemed all the more special for their rarity. For the dough, increase the cinnamon to ½ teaspoon. Before docking, dust each sheet of dough with a half batch of Cinnamon Sugar (page 44), or any Sugar Sprinkle (page 46). Otherwise, dock and bake as directed. After the crackers cool, gently tap each against the baking sheet to knock off any excess sugar.
Coconut (vegan): Replace the butter with 5 1/2 ounces (3/4 cup) virgin coconut oil (solid but creamy—about 70°F) and add 1 teaspoon pure coconut extract along with the vanilla.
Gingerbread: This variation has all the spicy complexity of a Christmas cookie, with the unique flavor and crunch of a classic graham. Make the dough with sorghum or unsulfured molasses (not blackstrap) and increase the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon. Along with the sugar, add 1 tablespoon orange zest, 2 teaspoons ground ginger, 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves, and a few cracks of black pepper.
Graham Cracker Crumb Crust: Combine 9 ounces (2 cups) finely ground graham cracker crumbs with 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) melted unsalted butter. Scatter into a 9-by-1 1/4-inch glass or ceramic pie plate and press into an even layer over the bottom and up the sides. Bake at 350°F until firm, about 18 minutes. Cool to room temperature for immediate use in your favorite recipe, or wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for up to 1 week.

Crispy-Skinned Fish,"2 6 ounces fillets branzino or black bass, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, Kosher salt","Title: Crispy-Skinned Fish
Instructions: Starting with parched skin is the key to a pro result— try to cook wet fish and it's going to steam, stick, rip, and generally be a huge, frustrating bummer. One hour before cooking, put your fillets on a plate, skin side up (no seasoning, please!), and leave them uncovered in the fridge to dry out.
Get a large stainlesssteel skillet ripping hot over high heat (2 minutes should do it), then pour in 1 tablespoon oil and add a big pinch of salt. Once the oil is smoking, take the skillet off the heat and use a handful of paper towels to wipe oil and salt around and out of the pan (be extra careful—you might want to use tongs to hold the towels).
Put your now-seasoned skillet back over high heat and take those beautiful air-dried fillets out of the fridge. Add another 1 tablespoon oil to the pan and hit both sides of each fillet with a decent amount of salt. Once the oil is shimmering, carefully lay a fillet skin side down in the pan (be sure to lay them going away from you to guard against spatters).
Use a fish spatula (call it a ""fish spat"" if you want to sound like a pro) to apply firm, even pressure to the fillet until it relaxes and lies flat. Repeat with remaining fillet, then keep at it!

Instructions: Pulse about 1/4 of onion rings, plus rosemary and garlic in a food processor until finely chopped. Add black pepper, poultry seasoning, and miso paste and purée until smooth. Add butter and purée — mixture will appear curdled.
Put oven rack in lowest position and preheat to 350°F. Rinse turkey inside and out, then pat dry.

French Buttercream,"1 cup water, 2 cups sugar, 2 tablespoons corn syrup, 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar, 5 egg yolks, 1 whole egg, 1/8 teaspoon xanthan gum, 1 1/2 pounds cold butter, preferably European","Title: French Buttercream
Instructions: In a heavy nonreactive saucepan, add water, then add sugar, corn syrup, and cream of tartar. The last 2 help keep the sugar from crystallizing. (Candy thermometer. Non-negotiable!)
Put the pot on high heat. It's going to be there for a while. Be patient and keep your eye on it. Don't go walking away and watching TV or something.
Put yolks and eggs in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment and turn to high. Just let it go! Eggs will triple in volume and go to ""ribbons stage."" You can't overwhip!
Wait on the sugar—looking for 230°F, aka ""soft ball."" When it happens, be ready to move quickly. Turn off the mixer and add the xanthan gum, turn back up to medium.
Remove the thermometer from hot sugar. Lift with two hands. Rest the lip of the saucepan on the edge of the mixer bowl.
Slowly tilt and pour sugar in a sloooow steady stream down the side of the bowl. Don't go too fast! If you do there will be chunks of scrambled eggs in your buttercream.
Once sugar is all in, turn the mixer to high. Beat until cool. Gauge this by putting the inside of your wrist to the outside of the bowl. It's more accurate than your hands. Switch out the whisk for the paddle. Next we're adding the butter. It's too heavy for the whisk and you'll end up breaking your stand mixer if you stay with the whisk.
Start cutting the butter into thin pieces—you could shave it with a cheese slicer if you'd like. Add butter piece by piece—pain in the derriere, yes, but we're making an emulsion.
See, if you dump all the butter in at once, the butter and eggs will never combine properly, and you'll have a ""broken"" buttercream. You'll be able to identify this easily—it'll be a chunky, watery, hot mess.
If your buttercream does break, you can fix it! Turn to medium high, then add a little more butter, piece by piece, until fixed. Or try adding a little guar gum! This is very strong, so add a pinch and beat for a minute, then check.
Once your butter is added, turn the mixer to medium high to add some air—10, 20 seconds at most. Quelle Magnifique! It should be fluffy and make you want to eat it with your fingers.
Once you have your base, there's so many ways to flavor it! Coffee powder! Vanilla beans! Dutch cocoa! Peanut butter! Caramel! Ham! Ok, maybe not ham. Party pooper.
Congratulations! You did it! You made French buttercream! You are a god amongst men!

Season inside of breast with 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, and 1/2 tsp. ground fennel. Transfer skin side up to a rimmed baking sheet; season with 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, and 1/2 tsp. ground fennel. Repeat with remaining breast. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour, or chill up to 24 hours for maximum flavor and juiciness (if chilled, let sit at room temperature 1 hour before roasting).
Arrange a rack in center of oven; preheat to 450°F. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add sausage, stirring and breaking up into small pieces with a spoon, until browned and cooked through, 5–7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sausage to a large bowl, leaving drippings behind.
Meanwhile, place croutons on a rimmed baking sheet. Crush slightly with the bottom of a small pot or pan until some pieces are smaller.
Return skillet to medium-high heat and melt 2 Tbsp. butter. Add onion, squash, chopped fennel, garlic, thyme, and remaining 1 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 6–8 minutes. Stir in kale, 2 Tbsp. butter, and 1 cup broth and cook, scraping up brown bits on bottom of pan, until kale is wilted and butter is melted, about 3 minutes. Transfer to bowl with sausage. Fold in croutons and parsley; if mixture seems dry, add 1/4 cup broth.
Flip breasts so they are skin side down. Divide stuffing between breasts, spreading with a spatula and leaving a 1"" border. Starting at 1 short end, roll each breast into a log, completely enclosing stuffing, then transfer each to separate, large pieces of cheesecloth. Wrap cheesecloth around turkey and secure by tying a piece of twine at each end (like a sausage). Tie 4–5 pieces of twine crosswise around log, spacing about 2–2 1/2"" apart. Rub remaining 4 Tbsp. butter all over breasts and transfer skin side up to roasting pan.
Pour enough broth (about 4 cups) to come 1/4"" up sides of turkey. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F and roast turkey, basting with pan juices every 20 minutes and adding more broth if pan starts to dry out, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 155°F, 60–70 minutes.
Transfer to a cutting board and let sit 15–20 minutes (internal temperature should rise to 165°F). Remove twine and slice crosswise about 1/2"" thick to serve.
Turkey can be seasoned 2 days ahead and stuffed, rolled in cheesecloth, and buttered 1 day ahead; loosely cover and chill. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour before roasting.",stuffed-turkey-breast-with-butternut-squash-kale-and-sausage

Basic Pull-Apart Challah,"2 ounces (1/4 cup) active dry yeast, 2 cups plus 3 tablespoons granulated sugar, 6 cups warm water (90° to 100°F), 1/4 cup kosher salt, 6 pounds high-gluten (bread) or all-purpose flour, 4 large eggs, separated, 1 1/4 cups canola oil, Cooking spray, 1/2 cup sesame seeds, 1/2 cup poppy seeds","Title: Basic Pull-Apart Challah
Instructions: 1. Bloom the yeast: Dissolve the yeast and 3 tablespoons sugar in 2 cups of the warm water in a medium bowl; set aside to bloom. If the yeast doesn't bloom after 5 minutes discard the mixture and start over.
2. Place the salt, flour, and the remaining 2 cups sugar together in a very large bowl and stir together. Add the 4 egg yolks. Make a well in the middle and add the yeast mixture and the remaining 4 cups water. Start kneading together; add 1/2 cup canola oil. Knead for 10 minutes, adding 1/2 cup canola oil, a small amount at a time, to create a workable dough. The dough will become a cohesive mass yet be a bit sticky. Rub a little of the remaining 1/4 cup canola oil over the top and sides of the dough. Loosely cover the dough with a kitchen towel and place the bowl in a warm spot for 15 minutes.
3. After 15 minutes, the dough will have relaxed a bit and should be easier to work with. Lightly oil your hands and knead the dough again until smooth and satiny, 2 to 3 minutes. Rub a little oil over the top and sides of the dough. Cover with a kitchen towel and place the bowl in a medium garbage bag. Place the open end loosely underneath the bowl to trap air. Let the dough rise in a warm dark corner of your kitchen until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
4. Uncover the dough. With lightly oiled hands, punch the dough down to release air. Cover again with the bag, loosely tucked under, and let rise for 1 hour.
5. Divide the dough into five equal parts, about 2 pounds each. Preheat oven to 375°F. Spray five 9-inch round baking pans with cooking spray.
6. Place one piece of dough on a smooth work surface. Squeeze out any air bubbles from the dough and roll in into a 12-inch rope. If the dough is sticking, lightly spray your work surface with cooking spray. Cut the rope into eight equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball. Place one ball in the center of the prepared pan and surround it with the remaining balls. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough so you have five pans of challah. Loosely cover each pan with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rise 15 minutes. (If you can't fit all the pans in your oven at once and you want your challahs to be as beautiful as possible, shape the remaining dough while the first round of challahs are in the oven so they don't see rise for too much longer than 15 minutes before baking.)
7. Beat the egg whites with 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl and brush the challahs. Sprinkle each with sesame or poppy seeds or a combination of the two.
8. Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350°F and bake until tops are dark golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes more. Let cool 15 minutes before serving warm, or cool completely on a wire rack.",basic-pull-apart-challah-51206820

Rinse the chicken, inside and out, under cold running water, then drain and blot dry, inside and out, with paper towels. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the rub inside the body and neck cavities, the rub another 1 tablespoon all over the skin of the bird. If you wish, rub another 1/2 tablespoon of the mixture between the flesh and the skin. Cover and refrigerate the chicken while you preheat the grill.
Set up the grill for indirect grilling (see below) placing a drip pan in the center. If using a charcoal grill, preheat it to medium.
If using a gas grill, place all the wood chips in the smoker box and preheat the grill to high; then, when smoke appears, lower the heat to medium.

Instructions: Lightly coat an 8 1/2x4 1/2"" loaf pan with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper, leaving a 2"" overhang on long sides. Place a sheet of parchment paper on work surface and lightly coat with nonstick spray. Beat white tahini and 1/2 tsp. salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on low speed just until smooth.
Meanwhile, place 2/3 cup sugar in a small saucepan and remaining 2/3 cup sugar in another small saucepan. Add 1/4 cup water to each saucepan and set both saucepans over low heat. Cook, stirring with a rubber spatula to dissolve, about 4 minutes. Keep 1 saucepan over low and increase heat to medium-high for other saucepan and fit with thermometer. Cook syrup, brushing down sides of saucepan with a wet pastry brush to dissolve any crystals, until thermometer registers 248°F, 7–10 minutes.
Immediately remove saucepan with boiling syrup from heat. Increase mixer speed to medium and gradually stream syrup into white tahini, aiming for the space between the sides of the bowl and the paddle. Beat just until halvah comes together in a smooth mass, less than a minute. (Do not overmix or it will be crumbly.) Working quickly, scrape onto prepared parchment and flatten with spatula until 3/4"" thick. Invert a medium bowl over halvah to keep warm.
Rinse any hardened sugar off thermometer; clip to second saucepan. Increase heat to medium-high and cook syrup, brushing down sides of saucepan with wet pastry brush, until thermometer registers 248°F, about 4 minutes.

Uncover white halvah (it should still be warm) and scrape black halvah on top; flatten to about the same shape as the white halvah. Using the sides of the parchment to lift edges, fold stacked halvah in half and flatten slightly. Repeat folding and flattening motions 4–5 times, rotating halvah as you work, to create a marbled effect (be careful not to work it too much or mixture will be crumbly). Press into prepared pan. Fold sides of parchment paper over top of halvah and let cool, at least 3 hours.
Lift halvah out of pan using parchment overhang. Peel away parchment; cut halvah crosswise into 1/2""-thick slices.

Transfer pork to a glass or ceramic shallow dish and marinate, covered and chilled, at least 8 hours.
Put pork, skin side up, in a flameproof roasting pan, discarding marinade, and bring to room temperature, about 1 hour.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle.
Cover pork with parchment paper and then tightly with foil and roast 2 1/2 hours. Discard foil and parchment, then add 1/2 cup water to pan and roast, uncovered, adding more water when liquid in pan evaporates (check about every half hour), until skin is browned and crisp and meat is fork-tender, 2 to 2 1/2 hours more. Transfer to a cutting board or platter, reserving juices in pan, and let stand 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, pour pan juices through a sieve into a fat separator or bowl and discard fat. Add 3/4 cup water to roasting pan and deglaze by boiling over medium-high heat (straddle 2 burners if necessary), scraping up brown bits, 1 minute, then add to pan juices along with enough water to bring total to 1 1/2 cups.
Cut skin off roast pork. (If skin is not crisp, roast in a shallow baking pan in a 475°F oven until crisp, about 10 minutes.) Cut skin into serving pieces. Pull meat from roast in pieces using a fork. Serve meat with pan juices and pork skin.",garlic-roasted-pork-shoulder-239994

Stars Pappardelle,"1/2 batch dough (your choice of color, Green Pea Dough as shown), Flour and semolina for dusting, 1/2 batch dough (your choice of color, Cacao Dough as shown), Kosher salt, A star-shaped plunger cutter","Title: Stars Pappardelle
Instructions: Choose which color of dough you want to be the background color for your stars and roll that dough to the third-thinnest setting on a pasta machine. Lightly dust a work surface with flour and place the pasta sheet on it. Using a star-shaped plunger cutter in any size you prefer, make star cutouts all over the sheet of pasta. I recommend spacing the star cutouts as close together as possible, because the sheet will get re-rolled and the stars will expand (doesn’t stars expanding blow your mind?). Cover this sheet with a kitchen towel. If you wish, save the tiny cutout stars to make pastina.
Roll the second dough on a pasta machine until it is the same size as the sheet with the star cutouts. Uncover the cutout pasta sheet and moisten it slightly with a kitchen brush dipped in water or a damp paper towel. Taking care to cover the cutout sheet precisely, lay the newly rolled sheet over the cutout sheet. Use a rolling pin to sandwich the two sheets together, rolling both lengthwise and crosswise.
Once you are sure the two sheets are sufficiently pressed together, use a bench scraper to carefully turn the pasta sheet over, revealing the star pattern. You may be able to make nips, tucks, and small adjustments at this point if you notice any bunching up of the pattern. Dust with flour as necessary to prevent sticking.
Roll the sheet through the pasta machine again, starting on the widest setting. Reduce the rollers to the second-widest setting and roll the opposite end of the sheet through first this time. Alternating the sides of the sheet you put through the pasta machine will ensure that the stars don’t skew too much in one direction. Keep reducing the rollers until you’ve rolled the pasta sheet through the middle thickness on the pasta machine. Your stars will look wide! Don’t worry; we’re about to fix that.
Lay the pasta sheet flat on your work surface and cut the whole sheet crosswise in 5-inch widths (or wider, up to the width of your pasta machine rollers). The star pattern has so far been skewed only side to side, making really wide stars, so now we’ll run the 5-inch sheets crosswise through the pasta machine, to stretch the stars back toward symmetry.
Feed the 5-inch widths of pasta through the pasta machine crosswise this time, perpendicular to the direction you had been feeding them through initially. Watch the star pattern and stop sheeting at your desired thinness, depending on how stretched or skewed you want the stars. I suggest stopping at the second-or third-thinnest setting.
Working with one sheet at a time, cut lengthwise strips 3/4 to 1 inch wide. Hang the noodles to rest on a pasta drying rack, dowel, or the back of a chair and repeat the process with the remaining pasta sheets.
Let the pappardelle rest for 30 minutes hanging, then gently place them on a parchment-lined and semolina-dusted sheet pan. You can boil them at this point or wait up to 2 hours at room temperature before boiling. If you would like to cook them another day, after they are leathery to the touch and no longer sticky, store the pasta on a sheet pan covered with plastic wrap in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Increase the cooking time by 1 minute if working with refrigerated pasta.
Boil in salted water for 2 minutes, drain, dress, and serve immediately.",stars-pappardelle

Instructions: 1. To make the filling, first water blanch the bok choy. In a pot, bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add the 1 tablespoon salt and the baking soda (if using). When the water returns to a boil, add the bok choy stalks and allow the water to return to a boil. Add the bok choy leaves and blanch for 1 minute, or until the leaves turn bright green. Immediately turn off the heat. Run cold water into the pot, then drain off the water. Repeat.
2. In a large bowl, place the bok choy, the 1 teaspoon salt, and all of the remaining filling ingredients. Using a wooden spoon or 2 pairs of wooden chopsticks, mix the ingredients together, stirring them in one direction. Stirring in this way ensures the mixture will become a cohesive filling. Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or up to overnight. The longer it rests, the easier it will be to work with.
3. To make the dough: In a large bowl, place the flour and make a well in the center. Gradually add the water to the well, and use your fingers to combine it with the flour until it is absorbed and a firm dough forms. If the dough is too dry, add a little more water. Knead the dough in the bowl for about 15 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and allow to rest for 1 1/2 hours.
4. Dust a work surface with flour. Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Work with 1 piece at a time, and keep the others covered with the damp cloth. Using your palms, roll into a log 12 inches long. Cut crosswise into 12 equal pieces. Using a small rolling pin, roll out each piece into a 3-inch round. Keep the work surface well dusted with flour as you work.
5. Place 1 round on the palm of one hand, place 1 tablespoon of the filling on the center, and fold the round into a half-moon. Using the thumb and forefinger of the other hand pleat the seam closed, making from 5 to 7 pleats. Repeat to form more dumplings until all of the rounds are used. Cover the dumplings with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out, then repeat with the remaining two pieces of dough in two batches to make a total of 36 dumplings.
6. In a cast-iron frying pan, heat 3 tablespoons of the peanut oil over high heat. When a wisp of white smoke appears, turn off the heat and place 18 of the dumplings in the pan. Turn on the heat to medium and allow the dumplings to cook for 3 minutes. Pour 1/2 cup of the water into the pan and allow the dumplings to cook for 7 to 10 minutes, or until the water evaporates. Reduce the heat to low and allow the dumplings to cook for about 2 minutes, or until they are golden brown on the bottom and the skins are translucent on top. To ensure the dumplings cook evenly, move the pan back and forth on the burner to distribute the heat evenly and prevent sticking.
7. Remove to a heated dish and serve. Because these dumplings are best eaten hot, serve in batches.",pot-stickers-357550

Pumpkin Stuffed with Everything Good,"1 pumpkin, about 3 pounds, Salt and freshly ground pepper, 1/4 pound stale bread, thinly sliced and cut into 1/2-inch chunks, 1/4 pound cheese, such as Gruyère, Emmenthal, cheddar, or a combination, cut into 1/2-inch chunks, 2-4 garlic cloves (to taste), split, germ removed, and coarsely chopped, 4 slices bacon, cooked until crisp, drained, and chopped (my addition), About 1/4 cup snipped fresh chives or sliced scallions (my addition), 1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme (my addition), About 1/3 cup heavy cream, Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg","Title: Pumpkin Stuffed with Everything Good
Instructions: Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment, or find a Dutch oven with a diameter that's just a tiny bit larger than your pumpkin. If you bake the pumpkin in a casserole, it will keep its shape, but it might stick to the casserole, so you'll have to serve it from the pot—which is an appealingly homey way to serve it. If you bake it on a baking sheet, you can present it freestanding, but maneuvering a heavy stuffed pumpkin with a softened shell isn't so easy. However, since I love the way the unencumbered pumpkin looks in the center of the table, I've always taken my chances with the baked-on-a-sheet method, and so far, I've been lucky.
Using a very sturdy knife—and caution—cut a cap out of the top of the pumpkin (think Halloween Jack-o-Lantern). It's easiest to work your knife around the top of the pumpkin at a 45-degree angle. You want to cut off enough of the top to make it easy for you to work inside the pumpkin. Clear away the seeds and strings from the cap and from inside the pumpkin. Season the inside of the pumpkin generously with salt and pepper, and put it on the baking sheet or in the pot.
Toss the bread, cheese, garlic, bacon, and herbs together in a bowl. Season with pepper—you probably have enough salt from the bacon and cheese, but taste to be sure—and pack the mix into the pumpkin. The pumpkin should be well filled—you might have a little too much filling, or you might need to add to it. Stir the cream with the nutmeg and some salt and pepper and pour it into the pumpkin. Again, you might have too much or too little—you don't want the ingredients to swim in cream, but you do want them nicely moistened. (It's hard to go wrong here.)
Put the cap in place and bake the pumpkin for about 2 hours—check after 90 minutes—or until everything inside the pumpkin is bubbling and the flesh of the pumpkin is tender enough to be pierced easily with the tip of a knife. Because the pumpkin will have exuded liquid, I like to remove the cap during the last 20 minutes or so, so that the liquid can bake away and the top of the stuffing can brown a little.
When the pumpkin is ready, carefully, very carefully—it's heavy, hot, and wobbly—bring it to the table or transfer it to a platter that you'll bring to the table.
You have a choice—you can either spoon out portions of the filling, making sure to get a generous amount of pumpkin into the spoonful, or you can dig into the pumpkin with a big spoon, pull the pumpkin meat into the filling, and then mix everything up. I'm a fan of the pull-and-mix option. Served in hearty portions followed by a salad, the pumpkin is a perfect cold-weather main course; served in generous spoonfuls, it's just right alongside the Thanksgiving turkey.
It's really best to eat this as soon as it's ready. However, if you've got leftovers, you can scoop them out of the pumpkin, mix them up, cover, and chill them; reheat them the next day.
There are many ways to vary this arts-and-crafts project. Instead of bread, I've filled the pumpkin with cooked rice—when it's baked, it's almost risotto-like. And, with either bread or rice, on different occasions I've added cooked spinach, kale, chard, or peas (the peas came straight from the freezer). I've made it without bacon (a wonderful vegetarian dish), and I've also made it and loved, loved, loved it with cooked sausage meat; cubes of ham are also a good idea. Nuts are a great addition, as are chunks of apple or pear or pieces of chestnut.",pumpkin-stuffed-with-everything-good-361169

Instructions: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 325°F. Oil terrine mold and line bottom with a sheet of wax paper (cut to fit), then oil paper.
Remove any visible silver skin or sinew from fish and cut on either side of pin bones until all pin bones have been removed, then cut fish into 1-inch pieces. Purée fish with salt, white pepper, and nutmeg in a food processor until very smooth. Add egg white and purée until incorporated, then transfer mixture to a bowl set in a larger bowl of ice.
Set tamis, screen side up, over a plate and work fish mixture through sieve about 2 tablespoons at a time with scraper until all that remains is sinews. Continue to work fish through sieve, scraping strained fish from underside of tamis from time to time and transferring to a large bowl set in another bowl of ice.
Weigh strained fish to determine equal amount of cream (1 cup cream weighs 8 ounces). Then, keeping fish mixture over ice, stir cream into fish mixture, about 1/4 cup at a time, with a large rubber spatula until all cream is incorporated.
Transfer one fourth of mixture to a small bowl and stir in dill. Gently fold salmon roe into remaining fish mixture.
Spread about two thirds of roe mixture in terrine and create a wide trough lengthwise along the middle with back of a spoon. Fill trough with dill mixture, mounding it slightly and smoothing surface. Cover with remaining roe mixture and rap mold firmly on counter to compact terrine. Smooth top with offset spatula and cover surface with an oiled sheet of wax paper (oiled side down).
Bake in awater bath until terrine is firm to the touch and separates easily from sides of mold and thermometer inserted diagonally through paper into center of terrine registers 110 to 120°F (a metal skewer or thin knife plunged to bottom of terrine for 5 seconds and removed will feel hot), 40 to 45 minutes.
Transfer terrine in mold to a rack and let cool 10 to 15 minutes before unmolding.
To unmold, remove wax paper and run a thin knife around inside edge of mold. Invert a cutting board or serving dish over terrine, then reinvert and remove mold and wax paper, blotting any excess liquid. Cut terrine into slices with a sharp knife, supporting each slice as cut with a flat metal spatula and transferring as cut to small plates.

Instructions: Grind the parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme into a fine powder. I use a coffee grinder for this.
In a mixing bowl, crumble the tofu and mix well with the spice mixture so that the herbs are well infused with the tofu. Let sit for the flavors to meld.
In a microwave-safe bowl, mix together the TVP granules and the broth, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and microwave for 5 to 6 minutes. Alternatively, bring the broth to a boil, pour over the TVP, cover, and let sit for 10 minutes.

(3 g) ground cardamom, 1 tsp. kosher salt, 6 Tbsp. room temperature unsalted butter, plus more for bowl, 6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature, 3 Tbsp. ground cinnamon, 1 1/2 cups (packed) brown sugar, divided, All-purpose flour (for surface)","Title: Glazed Cinnamon-Cardamom Buns
Instructions: Heat milk in a small saucepan over low until just warm; an instant-read thermometer should register 105°F–115°F. Pour into the large bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk in yeast and let sit until foamy, 10–15 minutes. You should see a layer of foam on the surface; this means that the yeast is active.
Add egg, egg yolk, flour, granulated sugar, cardamom, and salt to yeast mixture and mix with dough hook on low speed until well combined. Increase speed to medium and continue to mix until dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Gradually add butter 1 Tbsp. at a time, mixing to incorporate slightly before adding more. When 6 Tbsp. butter are incorporated, mix until dough is smooth, supple, and shiny, 10–15 minutes longer (you need to mix this long to develop the gluten).
Transfer dough to a large buttered bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel, and let sit at room temperature until doubled in size, 1–1 1/2 hours. Punch dough down, cover bowl tightly in plastic wrap, and chill overnight (the slow proof creates more flavor because it gives the yeast more time to process the sugar).
Mix butter, cinnamon, and 1/2 cup brown sugar in a medium bowl until combined.
Have your tools and filling nearby; you want to work quickly and keep dough as chilled as possible to make rolling more manageable. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured piece of parchment paper and roll to a 1/4""-thick rectangle, about 16""x12"". Cover with plastic and chill until dough is firm, 30–60 minutes.
Spread butter mixture over two-thirds of dough. Fold plain side over the middle, then fold opposite third over (like folding an envelope). Roll to a 12""x8"" rectangle about 1/2"" thick. Slice lengthwise into eight 1""-thick strips.
Working one at a time, lay strip on clean work surface with long side facing you. Using your palms, gently twist each end in opposite directions until entire strip is spiraled. Hold one end of strip between a thumb and index finger. Working away from you, tightly wrap strip around 3 fingers. Wrap around fingers again, placing second loop closer to the palm of your hand. As you bring strip across the back of your hand, cross over first loop, angling toward the end of your index finger. Cross dough over front of your hand and tuck the end into the center while removing your fingers and pushing through to the other side to create a knot. Check out step-by-step photos here. You want to twist these tightly so that they rise while baking. If you’re having trouble, twist them into any kind of knot that you can—just make sure it's wrapped tightly.
Divide cinnamon twists between 2 rimmed baking sheets, spacing evenly apart. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature until doubled in size, 45–60 minutes.
Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 325°F. Bake cinnamon buns, rotating pans from top to bottom halfway through, until deeply golden brown, 25–30 minutes.
Bring remaining 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan. Generously brush syrup over hot buns. If you like a sweeter pastry, wait 5 minutes, then brush again.

Meanwhile, cut frozen bacon crosswise into eight sections and distribute evenly in bowl of a food processor, then pulse until finely chopped.

Working with a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat the butter, sugar, salt and cinnamon, if you’re using it, together on medium speed for about 3 minutes, scraping down the bowl as needed, until well blended.
Mix in the vanilla and espresso extract on low speed. Turn off the mixer, add the flour all at once and pulse to begin incorporating it, then mix on low speed until the flour almost disappears into the dough. Scrape down the bowl, add the chopped chocolate and mix until evenly distributed. Give the dough a few last turns with a sturdy flexible spatula.
Turn the dough out onto the counter and divide it in half. Shape each half into a disk. Working with one piece of dough at a time, sandwich it between pieces of parchment paper and roll it to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Slide the dough, still sandwiched, onto a baking sheet—you can stack the slabs—and freeze the dough for at least 1 hour, or refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
Center a rack in the oven and preheat it to 325ºF. Butter or spray a regular muffin tin, or two tins, if you’ve got them. Have a 2-inch-diameter cookie cutter at hand.
Working with one sheet of dough at a time, peel away both pieces of paper and put the dough back on one piece of paper. Cut the dough and drop the rounds into the muffin tin(s).
The dough might not fill the molds completely, but it will once baked. Save the scraps from both pieces of dough, then gather them together, re-roll, chill and cut.
Bake the cookies for 18 to 20 minutes, or until they feel firm to the touch and have some color. Transfer the muffin tin(s) to a rack and leave the cookies in the tin(s) for about 10 minutes before carefully lifting them out onto the rack to cool completely.
Continue with the remainder of the dough, if you only baked one sheet, always using cool tins.
For Ringed Espresso-Chocolate Sablés: If you have 2-inch baking rings, use them to cut out the rolled dough. Bake the dough—in the rings—on lined baking sheets just as you would the muffin-tin cookies. Leave the rings in place for at least 20 minutes before lifting them off, rinsing and reusing.",espresso-chocolate-sables

Instructions: In a large bowl, mix together the meat, eggs, cheese, parsley, oregano, basil, onion, bread crumbs, and garlic, and season with salt and pepper. Add 1 cup of the water. Knead the water into the meat mixture with your hands. Knead and form meatballs into about 1 1/2-inch balls with a 2-ounce scoop (see Chef's Note) or roll into balls with your hands.
VAC-PACKED COOKING METHOD: Seal the meatballs with just a teaspoon of extra-virgin olive oil and cook them in 130°F water for 35 minutes.
OLD-WORLD COOKING METHOD: Place the meatballs in a large saucepan or skillet on the stove (use 2 pans if they don't all fit in a single pan), add 1/2 cup of the water over them (1/2 cup water to each pan if using 2 pans), and cover. Steam the meatballs over medium heat for about 25 minutes. Transfer to a platter and refrigerate until you're ready to grill them.
Turn a gas grill to high or ignite charcoal. When the grill is hot, for both gas and charcoal grills, clean your grill rack. Decrease the temperature to medium-high (on a gas grill only), and brush or wipe a little olive oil on the grill rack.
In batches, grill the meatballs in a cast-iron pan or plancha on the grill until they're well-browned all the way around, 4 minutes total for the vac-packed meatballs and about 6 minutes total for the pan-cooked meatballs. Remove from the heat and reserve.
Fill a large pot with about 5 quarts of water, add the kosher salt, and bring to a boil over high heat on your stove. Add the pasta and cook until just al dente, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain the pasta, reserving 1 cup of the pasta water.
Spread the pasta on a baking sheet and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, so it won't stick together.
Lightly oil a long, flat grill basket or spritz with nonstick cooking spray. With tongs, add half the pasta to the basket, arranging it in a thin even layer. (If you have two grill baskets, cook both batches of pasta at once.) Place the basket on a rack over hot coals and turn frequently, until the pasta turns a golden color. You'll hear it crackling during grilling.
Empty the grill basket into a large heat-proof bowl. Toss the pasta with 1 to 2 cups of Grilled Tomato Sauce. If it needs some moisture, add 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta water and toss again. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, and 2 tablespoons of the pecorino cheese. Toss. Transfer to a serving bowl, top with the remaining pecorino cheese, and serve immediately.",grilled-pasta-with-grilled-meatballs-51177600

Rolled Pork Loin Roast Stuffed With Olives and Herbs,"2-pound boneless pork loin roast, 1/2 teaspoon salt, Freshly ground black pepper, 2/3 cup olives, pitted and finely chopped (Niçoise, Picholine, Lucques, and/or Castelvetrano), 2 tablespoons capers (salt-packed and very well soaked to desalinate, or brined capers rinsed well), 1 garlic clove, pounded with a pinch of salt, 1 teaspoon finely chopped rosemary or sage leaves, 1 tablespoon chopped thyme leaves, 2 tablespoons chopped parsley, 1/4 cup good olive oil, 1 tablespoon cooking oil, olive or vegetable","Title: Rolled Pork Loin Roast Stuffed With Olives and Herbs
Instructions: Set the loin on a cutting board with one of the short, cut ends facing you. With a sharp knife, make a lengthwise horizontal cut, about a third of the way up one of the long sides, like asymmetrically splitting open a hot dog bun. Don’t cut all the way through, but nearly—far enough so that you can open up the roast like a book. If you started on the right, the left side will now be twice as thick as the right. At the hinge where they meet, make another horizontal cut midway up the left (thicker) side, so that you can open the roast again, like a magazine gatefold. Sprinkle the pork all over with the salt and pepper and set it aside.
Heat the oven to 425°F and make the stuffing by mixing all the remaining ingredients together (except the cooking oil). Spread the stuffing over the cut side of the pork loin, then roll it up and back into shape. Using cotton string, bind the roast with six little string belts.
Heat a skillet to high, add the cooking oil, and then carefully lay in the pork roast. Brown the roast on all sides and then put the skillet in the oven. Roast until it is just cooked through, about 20 minutes, then remove it from the pan and let it rest on a platter in a warm place for 10 minutes.

Gardener's Pizza,"Generous pinch of sugar, 1 1/4 cups/300 ml warm water {about 110°F/45°C}, One 1/4-oz/7-g package active dry yeast, 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling, 2 cups/255 g bread/strong flour, 1 to 1 1/4 cups/175 to 200 g whole-wheat/wholemeal or white whole-wheat/wholemeal flour, 1 tsp fine sea salt, Cornmeal or semolina flour, 4 to 6 oz/115 to 170 g cheese, such as shredded or fresh mozzarella, burrata, or fresh ricotta, 2 garlic cloves, very thinly sliced, 2 to 4 handfuls fresh veggies such as sliced tomatoes, arugula/rocket, sorrel, shaved zucchini/courgette, kale, Swiss chard, corn, or mushrooms, Handful of fresh herbs, such as basil, opal basil, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, Extra-virgin olive oil, Fine sea salt, Freshly ground black pepper","Title: Gardener's Pizza
Instructions: Make the dough: Whisk a pinch of sugar into the warm water in a small bowl and sprinkle the yeast over the top {yeast feeds on sugar so this helps to wake it up and get it going}.
Stir 3 cups/385 g of the flours and salt together in a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer to combine {reserving 1/4 cup/30 g flour for later}. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture. Stir with a fork or the dough hook to make a shaggy dough. If making the dough by hand, stir vigorously with a wooden spoon to work the gluten for about 5 minutes until the dough is smooth. Then turn onto a lightly floured countertop and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes, adding small sprinkles of flour as needed to just keep it from sticking. If you're using a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, beat on high speed until the dough comes together and slaps the side of the bowl, about 5 minutes, adding up to 1/4 cup/30 grams more flour as needed to create a cohesive ball.
Divide the dough half {for large pizzas} or quarters {for small pizzas} and form into balls. Place each ball of dough in a lightly oiled plastic bag, seal, and refrigerate overnight {it gets more supple as it sits overnight} or up to 3 days {or freeze for up to 1 week}.
Remove the dough from the fridge 2 hours before you plan to cook. Oil two or four bowls {depending on whether you are making two large or four individual pizzas}. Turn each dough ball in the bowl to coat in oil; cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap/cling film. Draw a circle around the top to mark where the dough is now, so you can watch it expand. Set aside in a warm place until doubled, about 2 hours.
Position a pizza stone on the bottom rack of your oven. Preheat the oven to 475°F/240°C/gas 9 at least 45 minutes before you plan to bake the pizzas.
Lightly dust a clean countertop and the dough with flour. Press and pat each ball of dough into a rectangle or round. Once you have the basic shape you want, stretch the dough by draping it over the back of your hands and wrists, letting it hang down so gravity does the work. For larger pizzas, aim for a 7-by-12-inch/17-by 30.5-cm rectangle or a 12-inch/30.5-cm round; for individual pizzas, aim for a 6-to-9-inch/15-to-23-cm round or rectangle for smaller pizzas and flatbreads, depending on how thick you like your dough. {Don't worry if it's misshapen.} Cover the dough with a towel until baking.
Generously dust a pizza peel or baking sheet/tray with cornmeal and lay on the dough, shaking the peel or sheet/tray back and forth a little to make sure the dough slides easily.
Chop or slice all the vegetables into small pieces that will cook quickly in the hot oven. Top the pizzas with any topping that needs to be cooked or melted, like cheese, sliced garlic, mushrooms, and small pieces of vegetables that need cooked through{the key is to use a light hand here, since overtopped pizzas tend to turn soggy}, dividing the toppings between all the dough.
Slide the pizza onto the stone {or cook directly on the baking sheet} and bake larger pizzas one at a time, smaller ones two at a time, until puffed, crisp and evenly baked through, about 8 to 10 minutes.
Remove and top with fresh and raw ingredients like shaved corn, sliced tomatoes, fresh basil, arugula/rocket, or sorrel. Shave or grate fresh Parmigiano-Reggiano over the top, drizzle with your best olive oil, and season with salt and black pepper.",gardeners-pizza-395569

"Three-Day, Twice-Cooked Pork Roast with Fried-Herb Salsa Verde","One 4 to 5-pound boneless, skinless pork shoulder, 1 tablespoon kosher salt, 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, plus more for reheating, 1 yellow onion, halved and thickly sliced, 1 large carrot, cut in thick slices, 1 celery stalk, cut in thick slices, 3 garlic cloves, unpeeled and cut in half, 1 bay leaf, 3 parsley sprigs, 3 thyme sprigs, 2 tablespoons fennel seeds, 1 tablespoon coriander seeds, 1 cup dry white wine, such as Riesling, 3 to 6 cups homemade chicken stock or water, Vegetable oil, for frying (about 1/2 cup), 1/4 cup rosemary leaves, 1/4 cup sage leaves, Pinch kosher salt, 1 bunch parsley, washed, dried, and leaves picked from stems, 1 to 2 garlic cloves, peeled, 1/2 cup good-quality extra-virgin olive oil, A grill, grill pan, griddle, or cast-iron skillet","Title: Three-Day, Twice-Cooked Pork Roast with Fried-Herb Salsa Verde
Instructions: Place pork shoulder on a rimmed baking sheet. Season with 1 tablespoon each kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Cover pork with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat oven to 400°F.
Heat a large heavy pot (such as a Dutch oven) over high; add 1/4 cup oil, onion, carrot, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables start to sizzle; reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, herbs, and spices and sauté for 1 minute more. Add the wine and bring to a simmer.
Place the pork on top of the aromatics and add enough stock or water to come halfway up the pork. Bring liquid to a simmer, and then cover pot with a lid or a couple layers of foil.
Transfer pot to oven and cook for 10 minutes; reduce heat to 325°F and cook until the meat is quite tender, about 3 hours. (To test for doneness, insert a slender, sharp knife into the middle of the roast; it should pull out easily.)
When meat is cooked, transfer it to a separate container, reserving the pan juices. Set a colander over a large bowl, and strain the pan juice into the bowl, pressing on the solids to extract all the liquid. Let strained pan juices until fat rises to the top, about 5 minutes. With a small ladle, skim off and discard the fat. Pour the skimmed, strained pan juices over the pork and let cool to room temperature; cover and refrigerate overnight.
One hour before you're ready to serve the pork, remove the meat from its cooking liquid and cut (while still cold) into neat 1-inch slices; set aside. Pour cooking liquid in a medium saucepan; bring to a simmer and reduce by a third. Season to taste, cover, and keep warm.
While your pork comes to room temperature, prepare the salsa verde. Line a large plate with a paper towel, and place it next to the stove, alongside a slotted spoon or ""spider"" spatula. In a small skillet, heat 1/2 inch of vegetable oil over medium heat. When the oil starts to look swirly, drop in a single rosemary leaf to test for readiness: if it sinks quietly to the bottom, the oil's not ready. When a leaf sizzles, but not in a frantic way, you are ready to fry.
Add the rosemary leaves to the oil and fry until the sizzling subsides, about 1 minute. Using the slotted spoon or spider, scoop the herbs from the oil and place the on the paper-towel-lined plate. Repeat with the sage leaves in the same oil; remove skillet from heat.
On a cutting board, gather the parsley leaves into a ball, holding them down on the cutting board as if they were trying to run away. Slice this parsley bundle thinly, as if it were a single vegetable. As you slice, the ball will come apart, but just bunch it back together as best you can, keep slicing, and you'll have a nice head start on the chopping that remains. Anchor the tip of the knife to the cutting board and use a paper cutter-like motion to chop away at your pile. Go over it a couple of times, then slide the knife under, like a spatula, and flip it over. Continue chopping and flipping until the parsley is finely chopped; transfer to a medium bowl.
Render the garlic a paste by either pounding it in a mortar with a pinch of salt, or with a knife on a cutting board, again with salt. When the garlic is almost a thick liquid, transfer it the bowl with the parsley; add the fried herbs and the olive oil. Stir salsa verde to combine, adding more salt or oil as needed.
Heat a grill, grill pan, griddle, or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, coat the grill or pan with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Working in batches and adding more oil as needed, cook until well browned and crispy on both sides, about 2 minutes per side.
Pour the reduced pan juices onto a serving platter with the pork (but not over the slices or they will lose some crispness) and arrange pork slices on top. Serve with salsa verde spooned over the top, or served alongside.",three-day-twice-cooked-pork-roast-with-fried-herb-salsa-verde-51262510

Instructions: 1. In a food processor or by hand, mix together all the dry ingredients and then add in the vegetable oil, followed by 1/3 cup water, mixing until a smooth, satiny, firm dough is formed.

Instructions: Preheat oven to 350°F
First, cook the sweet potatoes. Peel the sweet potatoes and cut them into 3/4-inch cubes.
Cut the bell peppers in half, cut out the stems and seeds, and cut the flesh into 3/4-inch cubes, then put them in the roasting pan. Use the back of a knife to lightly crush the 3 garlic cloves and add them to the pan. Drizzle with a little olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add the sweet potatoes to the peppers and put the pan in the oven for 10–15 minutes, until the peppers have small black patches on the skins.
Meanwhile, cut up store-bought sausages into bite-sized pieces and cook following the instructions on the package.
To make the piri piri sauce, peel and roughly chop the onion and garlic. Cut the bell pepper in half and cut out the stem and seeds. Rip the stems from the chiles, cut them in half lengthwise, and remove the seeds if you prefer a milder sauce. Put the onion, garlic, pepper, and chiles in the blender with the paprika, oregano, red wine vinegar, and basil. Grate in the zest of the lemon, then cut it in half and squeeze in the juice, catching any seeds. Add a drop of water and blend to a smooth paste. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary.
Remove the roasting pan from the oven. Transfer the sausages and piri piri sauce to the pan and mix everything together. Add the cherry tomatoes and put the pan back in the oven for 15 minutes, until the potatoes and peppers are cooked and the sauce is piping hot.

My Favorite Simple Roast Chicken,"One 2- to 3-pound farm-raised chicken, Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, 2 teaspoons minced thyme (optional), Unsalted butter, Dijon mustard","Title: My Favorite Simple Roast Chicken
Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450°F. Rinse the chicken, then dry it very well with paper towels, inside and out. The less it steams, the drier the heat, the better.
Salt and pepper the cavity, then truss the bird. Trussing is not difficult, and if you roast chicken often, it's a good technique to feel comfortable with. When you truss a bird, the wings and legs stay close to the body; the ends of the drumsticks cover the top of the breast and keep it from drying out. Trussing helps the chicken to cook evenly, and it also makes for a more beautiful roasted bird.
Now, salt the chicken—I like to rain the salt over the bird so that it has a nice uniform coating that will result in a crisp, salty, flavorful skin (about 1 tablespoon). When it's cooked, you should still be able to make out the salt baked onto the crisp skin. Season to taste with pepper.
Place the chicken in a sauté pan or roasting pan and, when the oven is up to temperature, put the chicken in the oven. I leave it alone—I don't baste it, I don't add butter; you can if you wish, but I feel this creates steam, which I don't want. Roast it until it's done, 50 to 60 minutes. Remove it from the oven and add the thyme, if using, to the pan. Baste the chicken with the juices and thyme and let it rest for 15 minutes on a cutting board.
Remove the twine. Separate the middle wing joint and eat that immediately. Remove the legs and thighs. I like to take off the backbone and eat one of the oysters, the two succulent morsels of meat embedded here, and give the other to the person I'm cooking with. But I take the chicken butt for myself. I could never understand why my brothers always fought over that triangular tip—until one day I got the crispy, juicy fat myself. These are the cook's rewards. Cut the breast down the middle and serve it on the bone, with one wing joint still attached to each. The preparation is not meant to be superelegant. Slather the meat with fresh butter. Serve with mustard on the side and, if you wish, a simple green salad. You'll start using a knife and fork, but finish with your fingers, because it's so good.",my-favorite-simple-roast-chicken-231348

Instructions: Have your fish store grind the fillets or pulse them yourself, one at a time, in a food processor or meat grinder.

Instructions: Preheat oven to 450°F with rack in lower third.
Rinse turkey inside and out and pat dry. Working from large cavity end, gently run your fingers between skin and meat to loosen skin, being careful not to tear skin. Push two thirds of truffle butter (4 ounces) under skin, including thighs and drumsticks, and massage skin from outside to spread butter evenly.

Instructions: In a 10- or 12-inch skillet, cook the sausage and bacon fully over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and cook until tender. Reserve the mixture in a bowl.
In a blender, whip the eggs and half-and-half until very light, about 90 seconds on high. (A milkshake blender, while not entirely necessary, does offer a little bit more fluff and a bit more fun.)
Give the skillet a wipe and warm it over medium heat. Swirl the butter in the hot pan to coat it completely. Pour the whipped eggs into the pan and cook until fully set around the outer edges, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the heat to low and top the whole surface of the omelet with the spinach and cheddar. Cook until the spinach is slightly wilted and the cheese begins to melt.
Add the sausage mixture to one side of the eggs and use 2 spatulas to fold the other half over the side with the sausage mixture. Cook until the eggs are set and the cheese is fully melted, another 2 minutes.

Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425°F. If convection is an option, choose it.
Make the ducks. Cut away the flap of fatty skin from the neck, and scrape any loose fat from inside the cavities. Prick the skin all over gently with a sharp fork, or cross-hatch it with a sharp knife. Be careful not to pierce the meat.
Fill an 18-quart stock pot (or as large as you have) about two-thirds full with water, and add the salt. Place the bunches of thyme and rosemary and the garlic cloves in it. Bring to a rapid boil. (You may need to use two pots if you do not have a single pot large enough to hold both ducklings at once; if so, divide the thyme and rosemary into smaller held-together bunches, and divide the garlic between the pots.) Place the ducks in the pot. If they pop up, keep them submerged using a smaller pot full of water or some other weight. Be aware of overflow. Bring the water back to a slow boil. Simmer the ducks for about 30 minutes. Remove them, and use paper towels to dry them thoroughly.
Stuff each of the ducks’ cavities with half of the boiled thyme, rosemary, and garlic and the quartered orange.
Line the bottom of a large shallow roasting pan with the onions, carrots, and the orange rounds. Place the ducks, breast-side down, on top. Massage them with the Cointreau. This will give them a mahogany finish. Let them sit for 10 minutes for the skin to absorb the liqueur. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Roast until the bottoms brown, about 20 minutes. Turn them breast-side up, and lower the oven temperature to 350°F. Several times during roasting, spoon off any excess fat as it accumulates, or suck it up using a baster. Use some of the fat to baste the ducks, and set the rest aside, saving some for the sauce.
Depending on how long you boiled the ducks and the size of the ducks, roasting time will be another hour or longer. The ducks are done when a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers at least 180°F, or until the juices run clear and the leg bones wiggle easily. You want the meat to slide off the bones. Don’t be afraid of overcooking these. Ducks don’t dry out easily. The skin should be crisp. If not, no worries. You will pass the pieces under the broiler before serving. (If the ducks are too crisp and the meat is not finished cooking, cover them with foil as you continue roasting.) Once the ducks are ready, remove them from the oven, and cover them with aluminum foil while you finish the sauce.
Meanwhile, make the sauce. Combine the stock, giblets, and necks in a saucepot over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle boil, until the stock is reduced by half.
Finish the sauce when you have retrieved rendered duck fat from the roasting duck. In a medium saucepan, warm the duck fat over medium heat. Add the flour, whisking with a fork as you do so. Remove the giblets and necks from the stock reduction, and discard. Add the stock to the duck fat–flour mixture, raise the heat to medium-high, and stir continuously to prevent lumps as you bring it to a slow boil. Add the Cointreau, vinegars, orange juice, marmalade, and orange peel to the pan. Bring back to a boil, melting the marmalade, then simmer uncovered on low heat until the sauce thickens and is reduced. Preheat a broiler with the rack set a notch or two down from the top position.
When the ducks have rested at least 20 minutes, use a sharp knife or poultry scissors to split them and cut the breasts from the legs. Discard the orange quarters, herbs, wings, and any pockets of fat that remain. Slip the breast meat from the bones. Leave the legs intact. Put a little sauce in a broiling pan, and lay the duck pieces on top. Spoon a little sauce on top of each piece. Put them under the broiler for about 1 minute to crisp and glaze. Watch them carefully; the sugar in the sauce caramelizes quickly.
Place the pieces on a platter, and decorate with thin, round slices of orange. Serve with additional sauce on the side.",roasted-ducklings-in-orange-sauce

Instructions: Trim the stems from the Swiss chard. Cut or tear the leaves into bite-sized pieces and set aside. Reserve half of stems for another use or discard them. Slice the remaining stems into 2-inch lengths, and then into halves, quarters, or eighths to make uniform matchsticks and transfer them to a medium bowl.
Slice the cucumber into 1/2-inch-thick rounds, then stack them up and slice into matchsticks. Slice the carrot into thin (less than 1/4-inch) rounds. Slice the radishes into thinnest possible rounds. Add the vegetables to the bowl with the chard stems. Toss with the sugar and 3/4 teaspoon of the salt and let stand as you prepare the rest of the meal. Just before serving, rinse and drain the veggies, blot dry with a clean towel, and toss with the rice vinegar.
Meanwhile, place a skillet over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon neutral-tasting oil. Using tongs, add the Swiss chard leaves in increments, adding more as each batch cooks down. Add a big pinch of salt and cook, stirring frequently with the tongs for 3 to 5 minutes, until wilted and the pan appears mostly dry. Remove from the heat and gather up the greens to one side of the pan with a spatula. Holding the chard in place and gently squeezing, tilt the pan over the sink and pour off any excess liquid. (You can do this in a colander if you’re worried about accidently dumping the greens into the sink.) Place the chard in a bowl and stir in 1 teaspoon sesame oil and the sesame seeds.

To serve, use a spatula to scoop out the rice and divide it among four bowls, ensuring that everyone gets some of the crispy part. Top with the Swiss chard, kimchi, and avocado, then use a slotted spoon to add the pickled vegetables to the bowls. Garnish with the nori and serve immediately, passing the Gochujang sauce at the table.",spring-bibimbap

Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C/gas 4.
Put the pretzels into a resealable plastic bag and crush them with a rolling pin into pieces that are no larger than 1/4 in/6 mm. (Or pulse the pretzels in a food processor, if you prefer.) Pour the crushed pretzels and their crumbs into a medium bowl and stir in the butter and brown sugar. Press the crust mixture into the bottom of a 9-in/23-cm springform pan, covering the bottom of the pan evenly. Bake the crust until it is lightly toasted, 10 to 12 minutes. It will be soft and puffy when you first remove it from the oven, but will harden as it cools. Set the crust aside to cool completely.
Put the bowl of a stand mixer and the whip attachment in the freezer for 10 minutes.
Attach the bowl and the whisk attachment to the mixer, and pour in the cream. Begin whipping the cream on medium speed. When it starts to thicken, pour in 2 tbsp of the granulated sugar and the vanilla. Whip the cream mixture on medium speed until soft peaks form. (When you dip a spoon into the whipped cream and pull it out, the cream should form a peak that curls back onto itself.) Set aside 1 1/2 cups/360 ml of the whipped cream in a small bowl. Transfer the remaining whipped cream to a separate bowl, cover, and refrigerate; you will use it to top the tart later.
Put the remaining 1/2 cup/100 g of granulated sugar and the cream cheese in the bowl of the stand mixer. Using the paddle attachment, beat the sugar and cream cheese together on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Remove the bowl from the mixer, and stir the reserved 1 1/2 cups of whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until it is homogenous. Spread the cream cheese filling evenly over the cooled crust. Be sure to completely cover the crust, spreading the filling to the edges of the pan. Use a damp paper towel to wipe down any specks of filling clinging to the sides of the pan or the edges of the tart will appear messy when the springform is removed. Refrigerate until chilled and set, 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring 1/2 cup/120 ml of the water to a boil over high heat. Put the gelatin powder in a medium heat-proof bowl and pour in the boiling water. Stir until the gelatin is completely dissolved. Stir in the remaining 1/4 cup/60 ml of cold water. Allow the gelatin to cool to room temperature.
While the gelatin cools, arrange the strawberries, cut-side down, over the cream cheese filling to cover the entire top of the tart. Start by lining the edge of the tart with a ring of strawberries and work your way to the center in a target pattern. The tips of the berries should be pointing straight up. Pour the gelatin over the strawberries and cream cheese layer, coating the tops of the strawberries in the gelatin as you pour. Refrigerate, covered, until the gelatin is completely set, at least 1 hour. (The tart can be refrigerated up to 1 day before serving.)
Remove the sides of the pan and transfer the tart (still on the springform base) to a serving platter. Gently rewhisk the reserved whipped cream for 10 to 15 seconds and pile it in the center of the tart, if you wish or pass at the table.

Chocolate-Covered Marshmallow Cookies,"3/4 cup almond flour or meal, 2/3 cup rice flour, 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 1/3 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 1 large egg yolk, 1 (1.2-ounce) bag freeze-dried strawberries, 1 envelope unflavored powdered gelatin (about 2 1/2 teaspoons), 2 large egg whites, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 2 teaspoon plus 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 2 tablespoon light corn syrup, 12 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, chopped, 2 tablespoon virgin coconut oil, Pearl sugar and/or red sanding sugar (for serving; optional), Red luster dust (for serving; optional), A 1–1 1/4-inch–diameter cookie cutter; candy thermometer","Title: Chocolate-Covered Marshmallow Cookies
Instructions: Whisk almond flour and rice flour in a medium bowl. In the bowl of a stand mixer, on medium speed, beat butter, granulated sugar, powdered sugar, and salt until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Reduce speed to low and beat in egg yolk, then dry ingredients.
Roll out dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper to 1/4"" thick. Using parchment, slide dough onto a baking sheet and chill until firm, 30–40 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Peel away top layer of parchment paper from dough and punch out rounds with cutter; transfer cookies to another parchment-lined large baking sheet, spacing at least 1"" apart. (You should have 36 cookies; if desired, gather scraps and save for another use.)
Bake cookies until edges are golden but centers are still pale, 10–12 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets.
Line another rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack inside. Transfer cooled cookies to rack.
Pulse strawberries in a food processor until finely ground. Pass through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl to remove larger pieces; set strawberry powder aside.
Place 1/4 cup cold water in a small bowl and sprinkle gelatin over top; let sit until gelatin is softened, 10–15 minutes.
Beat egg whites, salt, and 2 tsp. granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on medium-high speed to soft peaks.
Heat corn syrup, remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar, and 3 Tbsp. water in a small saucepan over medium-low, stirring with a heatproof spatula until sugar is dissolved. Fit saucepan with thermometer and bring syrup to a boil; cook, brushing down sides of saucepan with a wet pastry brush to dissolve any crystals, until thermometer registers 242°F. Working quickly through the next few steps, immediately remove syrup from heat and add gelatin mixture, stirring with spatula just until melted. With mixer on medium speed, gradually stream syrup into egg whites, aiming for the space between the sides of the bowl and the whisk. Increase speed to high and beat until marshmallow is very light, thick, and glossy and the sides of the bowl feel cool to the touch, 10–12 minutes. Beat in reserved strawberry powder.
Transfer marshmallow mixture to a disposable pastry bag and snip a 1"" opening off the end (or use a resealable plastic bag and cut off 1 corner). Position end of piping bag 1/2"" from surface of cookie, holding bag perpendicular; applying even pressure, begin slowly piping (do not move the bag). Pipe until marshmallow has expanded to the diameter of the cookie, then slowly lift the tip upward to create a soft peak. (Imagine a tall Hershey’s Kiss shape about 2"" high.) When all the cookies have been topped with marshmallow, chill uncovered on baking sheet until marshmallow is set, 2–2 1/2 hours. (Loosely cover at this point and chill up to 12 hours if desired.)
Heat chocolate and oil in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water (do not let water touch bottom of bowl), stirring until chocolate is melted and incorporated. Let cool slightly.
Drizzle a level tablespoon of chocolate mixture over each marshmallow cookie, coating completely. Sprinkle with pearl and/or sanding sugar if desired.
Once all cookies have been coated, use a small offset spatula to nudge at the base across the rack to remove any drips. Chill until chocolate is set, at least 30 minutes. Decorate with luster dust if desired.",chocolate-covered-marshmallow-cookies

Pecan Praline Thumbprints,"1 3/4 cups (6 ounces) toasted, salted pecan pieces, 3/4 cup granulated sugar, 1 cup (8 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature, 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, 3/4 teaspoon sea salt flakes, 3/4 cup (6 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature, 1/2 cup maple syrup, 1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar, 1/4 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar, 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon sea salt flakes, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1 1/4 cups (4 1/2 ounces) toasted, salted pecan pieces","Title: Pecan Praline Thumbprints
Instructions: In a food processor, pulse the pecans and 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar until a fine meal forms but before the nuts start to release their oils.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the butter briefly on medium speed for 5 to 10 seconds. Add the remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar and beat together until the butter mixture is aerated and pale in color, approximately 4 minutes. Briefly beat in the vanilla. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula to bring the batter together.
In a bowl, whisk together the flour and salts. Add the dry ingredients all at once and mix on low speed until the dough comes together but still looks shaggy, approximately 30 seconds. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to bring the batter together. Mix for another 10 seconds on medium speed. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer. With a plastic bench scraper, bring the dough completely together by hand.
Stretch out a long sheet of plastic wrap on a work surface and put the dough on top. Pat into an 8-inch square, using the bench scraper to square off the sides. Wrap tightly and refrigerate until chilled throughout, at least 30 minutes or up to 3 days.
Heat the oven to 350°F. Line a couple of half sheet (13 by 18-inch) pans with parchment.
Cut the dough into 6 even strips. Roll the strips back and forth into logs to round out the edges. Using the top half of your thumb as a guide, cut each log into 8 pieces but keep the log together. Roll the logs again to round out the edges, then pull the pieces apart and place cut-side up on the prepared pans, evenly spacing up to 20 cookies per pan. With the tip of your index finger, make an indentation into the center of each cookie.
Bake one pan at a time for 8 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and tap down the centers with the rounded end of a wooden spoon or a cocktail muddler. Rotate the pan and bake until the cookies have slight cracks on the top and are set, another 4 to 6 minutes. When ready, the cookies will have set around the edges and you will be able to gently move them, but they still will be soft. Let the cookies cool completely on the pan. Repeat with the remaining pan.
While the cookies are baking, start the praline. In a pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Mix in the maple syrup, sugars, vanilla, and salts and stir until homogeneous. Bring the mixture to a boil and boil for 3 minutes to thicken. Pour in the heavy cream, stirring to combine. Let the mixture reduce for 3 to 4 minutes, or until it lightly coats the back of a spoon. Stir in the nuts. You will have approximately 2 1/2 cups of praline.
While the thumbprints are still warm, use a small spoon to scoop the goopy praline into the centers. (It is okay if some spills over on the sides.) Refrigerate until set, approximately 30 minutes.",pecan-praline-thumbprints-56389460

Diamond Crystal kosher salt, 1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for surface, 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces, 1 large egg yolk, 3 Tbsp. chilled milk or water, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1/8 tsp. cream of tartar, 6 Tbsp. chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces, 1/3 cup heavy cream, 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal kosher salt, 4 oz. semisweet chocolate (do not go above 70% cacao), finely chopped, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, Flaky sea salt, A 9"" or 10"" tart pan with removable bottom","Title: Salted Caramel–Chocolate Tart
Instructions: Whisk cocoa, sugar, salt, and 1 2/3 cups flour in a medium bowl. Add butter and toss to coat. Using your fingers, smash butter into dry ingredients until it nearly disappears (you shouldn’t see any large bits) and mixture holds together when squeezed—you’re working it more than you would pie dough. Make a well in the center and add yolk and milk. Using a fork, gradually incorporate flour mixture until you’ve got a shaggy dough. Knead a couple of times in bowl until no dry spots remain and dough is smooth. Flatten into a 3/4""-thick disk, wrap tightly in plastic, and chill until firm, about 2 hours. (You can make the caramel filling during this time.)
Preheat oven to 350°F. Let dough sit 5 minutes to soften slightly. Roll out on a lightly floured surface to a 14"" round about 1/8"" thick, dusting with more flour as needed to prevent sticking. Lift dough on one edge and throw a pinch of flour on surface. Slide bottom of tart pan under dough, positioning it roughly in the center. Fold in edges of dough so it’s resting fully on insert; place inside tart ring and unfold edges so they gently slump against sides of pan and excess dough is hanging over the edges. Press dough firmly into bottom of pan with floured hands, then use a straight-sided measuring cup to firmly press sides of dough into grooves and up sides of pan. Roll pin over top edge of pan to shear off excess dough flush with pan. Reserve dough scraps for patching any potential cracks later. Prick bottom of dough all over with a fork and chill in freezer until very firm, 10–15 minutes.
Place tart pan on a rimmed baking sheet and line with a sheet of parchment paper or foil. Fill with pie weights or dried beans and bake until edges of crust are set and starting to look dry, 12–15 minutes. Carefully lift parchment with weights. Patch any visible cracks with reserved dough. Return crust to oven and bake until firm and dry all over, 18–22 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool.
Bring sugar, cream of tartar, and 1/3 cup water to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-low, stirring with a heatproof spatula until dissolved. Cook, swirling pot often but not stirring, until mixture turns deep amber and wisps of smoke rise from the surface, 8–10 minutes. Remove caramel from heat and immediately stir in butter a piece at a time until smooth (be careful; mixture will sputter). Gradually stir in cream, then add salt. Transfer caramel to a heatproof measuring glass (you should have about 1 1/2 cups). Let cool until warm.
Pour caramel into cooled tart shell. Chill until caramel is set, at least 1 hour.
Place chocolate, cream, and butter in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (bowl should not touch water). Stir with a heatproof spatula until ganache is smooth, about 5 minutes. Let cool until thickened enough to hold an indentation from a spoon.
Remove tart from refrigerator and scrape ganache over caramel. Using a spoon, gently work ganache over surface, creating decorative swooshes and swirls. Sprinkle with sea salt; let sit until ganache has lost its sheen, 10–15 minutes.
Dough can be made 2 days ahead; keep chilled. Crust can be baked 1 day ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature. Caramel filling can be made 3 days ahead; cover and chill. Microwave in 20-second intervals, stirring in between, just until pourable. Caramel-filled tart can be made 1 day ahead; once it’s set, cover and keep chilled. Tart can be assembled 1 day ahead. Chill until ganache is set, then cover loosely. Let sit at room temperature 15 minutes before slicing.",salted-caramel-chocolate-tart

Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C/180°C fan/gas 6 and line a baking tray with baking parchment.
Place the rhubarb in a saucepan with the sugar and orange juice. Simmer over a medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the rhubarb pieces have completely broken down and the mixture is thick and sticky. Spoon into a small jar or ramekin and leave to cool.
To make the scones, place the flour in a large bowl and add the cubes of butter. Quickly rub the butter into the flour using your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar and make a well in the centre.
Pour the honey into the centre of the well, then gradually add the milk, stirring it into the mixture using a round-ended knife. A soft, rough dough will form. Tip the dough out on to a lightly floured worktop and knead very briefly to smooth out the dough. Over-handling the dough will make your scones tough and flat, so knead as little as possible.
Gently roll the dough out to a thickness of around 3cm (1 inch). Cut into rounds using a 6cm (2 1/3-inch) pastry cutter, cutting straight down and not twisting, as twisting prevents the scones from rising properly. Very gently re-roll the remaining dough, taking care not to handle it too much, and punch out more scones—you should get 9 in total. Arrange the scones on the lined baking tray and brush the tops with a little extra honey.
Bake for 12–15 minutes or until risen and golden brown. Serve warm from the oven, split in half, with big dollops of clotted cream and rhubarb compote.",honey-scones-with-rhubarb-compote

If thermometer does not read 165°F, transfer stuffing to microwave-safe baking dish and microwave on high until 165°F, about 3 minutes for 10 degrees. Cover and keep warm. Using turkey holders (or by inserting large metal serving spoon into body cavity), transfer turkey to large serving platter. Let stand 30 minutes before carving.
Meanwhile, bake extra stuffing and make gravy: Raise oven temperature to 350°F. Remove giblets and neck from roasting pan and discard. Pour pan juices into measuring cup or gravy separator. Let stand until fat rises to top, 1 to 2 minutes, then skim off and reserve fat or, if using separator, carefully pour juices into measuring cup, reserving fat left in separator.
Transfer foil-covered dish of extra stuffing to oven and bake 10 minutes. Meanwhile, add enough remaining stock to pan juices to total 4 cups. Measure turkey fat, adding melted butter if necessary to total 6 tablespoons. Straddle roasting pan across 2 burners on moderate heat and add fat. Whisk in flour, scraping up browned bits on bottom of pan, then cook, whisking constantly, 1 minute. Whisk in pan juice–stock mixture and bring to a boil, whisking often. Reduce heat to moderately low and simmer, whisking occasionally, until gravy thickens, about 5 minutes. Whisk in remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and keep warm. (Gravy can be kept warm over very low heat, covered, up to 20 minutes. If it thickens, thin with additional stock before serving. If skin forms on top, whisk well to dissolve.)
When extra stuffing has baked 10 minutes, remove foil and bake, uncovered, until heated through, about 10 minutes. Pour gravy through fine-mesh sieve into large bowl, then transfer to gravy boat. Carve turkey and serve gravy and stuffing alongside.
•To combat dryness, most frozen turkeys and some fresh are injected with a saline solution. This is not a good thing, though: Injected birds generally lack flavor and can have a mushy texture. For this reason, we recommend buying a fresh turkey and checking the label to be sure there aren't any additives. (Look for the words ""all natural."") Don't be too concerned, though, with the many other terms that can be applied to turkeys, such as free-range, organic, or heritage. All can be excellent.
•When buying a fresh bird, be sure to purchase it no more than two days before Thanksgiving. If you must get a frozen bird, defrost it in the refrigerator in a pan to catch drips, allowing a full 24 hours for each 5 pounds.
•Warm, moist stuffing is an optimal environment for bacteria such as salmonella or E. coli to multiply, so it's important to follow safe procedures. Be sure to make the stuffing at the last minute so it can go into the bird warm. This helps it move above the ""danger zone"" (the optimal temperature range for bacteria growth) more quickly during roasting. When you remove the turkey from the oven, be sure to check the temperature in the middle of the stuffing to make sure it's 165°F, the temperature at which bacteria will be killed. If it's not 165°F, scoop it out of the cavity and microwave it as directed in the recipe.
•More stuffing tips: Be sure not to overpack the cavities, as the stuffing will expand during cooking. Loosely fill the turkey, then spread the extra in a casserole dish (no more than 2 inches deep) and bake it after the turkey comes out (be sure to refrigerate it until then to impede bacteria growth). Drizzle the portion in the casserole dish with extra stock to make up for the juices it won't get from the turkey. If you want the stuffing that's cooked inside the turkey to be extra-moist (as opposed to having a crisp crust where it's exposed), cover the exposed portion with a small piece of aluminum foil.
•Opinions vary on whether or not to stuff the bird—some people think it can cause uneven cooking. If you prefer not to stuff your bird, fill the cavities with a chopped vegetable and herb mixture that will impart its flavor to the meat and pan juices: Chop 1 onion, 1 celery rib with leaves, 1 carrot, and 3 tablespoons fresh parsley. Mix this with 1 teaspoon each dried rosemary, sage, and thyme. Sprinkle the cavities with salt and freshly ground black pepper and place the mixture inside. An unstuffed bird will take about 15 minutes to a half hour less to cook than a stuffed bird. When the turkey is cooked, tilt it to allow any juices that have collected in the cavity to drain into the pan. Do not serve the vegetable mixture, as it may not have cooked to a safe temperature.
•This recipe can easily be scaled up to serve more people. Estimate about 1 to 1 1/2 pounds per person. Cooking times (for a stuffed bird, cooked at 325°F to an internal temperature of 180°F) will be as follows: 8 to 12 pounds: 3 to 3 1/2 hours 12 to 14 pounds: 3 1/2 to 4 hours 14 to 18 pounds: 4 to 4 1/4 hours 18 to 20 pounds: 4 1/4 to 4 3/4 hours 20 to 24 pounds: 4 3/4 to 5 1/4 hours
•Some experts prefer to cook their turkeys to an internal temperature of 170°F (rather than 180°F, as in this recipe). If you don't mind having the meat slightly pink, this is perfectly safe and makes it more moist. However, Rick Rodgers, who created this recipe, believes that the dark meat in particular does not achieve its optimum flavor and texture until it reaches 180°F. If you choose to stuff your turkey and cook it to only 170°F, its stuffing will almost definitely not reach the safe temperature of 165°F. When you remove the turkey from the oven, be sure to check the temperature in the center of the stuffing, and if necessary remove it and microwave it as directed in the recipe.
•Letting the turkey stand for half an hour after it comes out of the oven is an essential part of the roasting process. When meat roasts, its juices move to the outer edge of the flesh. Letting it rest gives the juices time to redistribute, making for a moister turkey. An added bonus: The resting time provides an excellent window of opportunity to make the gravy and reheat the side dishes. There's no need to cover the bird—it'll stay warm enough, and covering it would only soften the crispy skin.",classic-roast-turkey-with-herbed-stuffing-and-old-fashioned-gravy-240444

Santiago de Cuba's Roast Pork Marinated in a Garlicky Allspice-Cumin Adobo (Cerdo Brujo),"1 head garlic, separated into cloves and peeled, 1 tablespoon salt, 2 teaspoons black peppercorns, 2 teaspoons ground cumin, 2 teaspoons allspice berries or ground allspice, 3/4 cup bitter orange juice (from about 6 oranges) or equal parts lime juice and orange juice, 1 cup sweet orange juice diluted with about 1/4 cup water, One 8- to 9-pound leg of pork, with skin, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 cup sweet sherry or port wine, for deglazing","Title: Santiago de Cuba's Roast Pork Marinated in a Garlicky Allspice-Cumin Adobo (Cerdo Brujo)
Instructions: Place the garlic, salt, peppercorns, cumin, and allspice in a large mortar and pound to a paste with a pestle. Stir in the bitter orange juice. (You can also puree these ingredients in a blender or food processor.) Set aside.
Trim the skin from the inner part of the leg only. Wipe the meat clean with a damp cloth. Make several deep incisions all over the skinned portion and rub with the salt. Let rest for a few minutes. Rub the marinade all over the pork, pushing it into the gashes and between the meat and the skin. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours or a maximum of 12 hours. Wipe the marinade from the skin with a clean cloth.
Preheat the oven to 400°F. Place the pork in a roasting pan and bake uncovered, skin side up, for 3 to 4 hours. Check the roast often. As the pan juices evaporate, replenish them with a little of the diluted sweet orange juice. The pork is done when the skin is crackling and the juices run clear when the meat is pierced at the thickest part of the leg (about 160°F on a meat thermometer).
Remove the pork from the oven and lift it onto a cutting board, holding the bone with a cloth. With a sharp knife, remove the crisp skin and cut it into small serving pieces. Place them on a cookie sheet and set in the turned-off oven, uncovered (if you cover the crackling, it steams and gets soggy).
To deglaze the pan juices, place the roasting pan on the stove over medium heat and add the sherry, scraping up the browned bits with a wooden spoon.
Carve the pork and return to the roasting pan with the pan juices to keep the meat moist and flavorful. Pork dries out easily, so if you must hold it for more than 30 minutes, cover the pan with aluminum foil and return it to a warm oven.",santiago-de-cubas-roast-pork-marinated-in-a-garlicky-allspice-cumin-em-adobo-em-em-cerdo-brujo-em-51203240

Instructions: To make the praline, line a baking sheet with waxed paper.
Combine the water and the sugar in a saucepan over high heat. Gently swirl the pan around to melt the sugar evenly. Using a candy thermometer, cook the sugar until it reaches 370°F. Add the pecan halves to the caramel and quickly stir the nuts to coat them thoroughly with the caramel. Spoon the praline onto the waxed paper in an even layer to cool. Once the praline has cooled, chop it finely with a knife and reserve.
To make the parfait, line a 9 by 5 by 3-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, letting enough excess wrap hang over the sides to cover the top.
Using a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the heavy whipping cream on medium-high speed until it reaches stiff peaks. Remove the bowl from the mixer and, with a rubber spatula, fold the sour cream into the whipped cream. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and refrigerate until needed.
Have the egg yolks and egg whites in separate bowls. Put the egg yolks in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and add 1/4 cup of the sugar. Whisk the mixture on high speed until you achieve a thick, pale yellow consistency. Transfer the mixture to another bowl and reserve.

Instructions: 1. Prepare the ribs and rub: Remove the thin, papery skin from the back of each rack of ribs by pulling it off in a sheet with your fingers, using the corner of a kitchen towel to gain a secure grip, or with pliers.
2. Combine the paprika, black pepper, brown sugar, salt, celery salt, cayenne, garlic powder, dry mustard, and cumin in a small bowl and whisk to mix. Rub two thirds of this mixture over the ribs on both sides, then transfer the ribs to a roasting pan. Cover and let cure, in the refrigerator, for 4 to 8 hours.
3. Prepare the mop sauce (if using): Mix together the cider vinegar, mustard, and salt in a bowl and set aside.
4. Set up the grill for indirect grilling and place a large drip pan in the center.

Lavash,"½ cup [70 g] all-purpose flour, ¼ cup plus a scant 1 Tbsp [70 ml] lukewarm water, ¼ tsp instant yeast, 1 cup [240 ml] lukewarm water, 1 Tbsp sunflower oil or other neutral oil, 2 tsp kosher salt, 3 cups plus 2 Tbsp [440 g] all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting","Title: Lavash
Instructions: To make the old dough, using your hands or a rubber spatula, squish together the flour, water, and yeast in a bowl until it forms a thick paste. Scrape the paste into a small, lightly oiled container, cover, and let it sit out for 1½ to 2 hours, or refrigerate overnight and bring to room temperature for at least 2 hours before using. When ready, the ball will have doubled in volume.
In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the old dough, water, oil, and salt. Squish the old dough with your hands to break it up in the water; it doesn’t have to be perfectly mixed in.
Fit the stand mixer with the paddle attachment and add a third of the flour. Mix on low speed until the dough looks like pancake batter. Add the remaining flour and mix on low speed until incorporated. Remove the paddle attachment, pulling off any dough stuck to it. If there is flour at the base of the bowl, use your hands to press the dough into the flour. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let the dough sit for 20 minutes to allow the flour to hydrate.
Remove the towel and attach the dough hook to the stand mixer. Mix the dough on medium speed until the dough releases from the sides of the bowl without sticking and feels smooth to the touch, about 4 minutes. Turn the mixer off and reposition the dough to the center of the bowl if it seems to get stuck on one side of the bowl.
Combine the old dough, water, oil, and salt in a large bowl and mix together, squishing the old dough into the water with your hands. Stir in the flour gradually with your fingers until a crumbly dough forms, then knead it a few times in the bowl by folding the dough over itself and pressing it down into the bowl. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let the dough rest for 20 minutes.
Dust the counter lightly with flour and place the dough on top. Begin kneading by stretching and folding the dough over itself until it is smooth to the touch, 5 to 7 minutes.
Lightly oil an 8 cup [2 L] glass Pyrex or a large glass bowl and place the dough inside. Cover the bowl with a lid, a plate, or plastic wrap, and let it rest for 3 hours or until doubled in volume. Or refrigerate overnight and let the dough come to room temperature for at least 2 hours before portioning.
To portion and shape the dough, dust the counter lightly with flour and place the dough on top. Using a bench scraper or knife, cut the dough into eight pieces about 3.5 oz [100 g] each.
To shape the dough, cup the palm of your hand over one portion at a time and move your hand in a circle. The friction from the counter will help form the dough into a ball. If there is too much flour on the surface and the dough is sliding around, give the counter a spritz of water and try again. Lightly oil a rimmed tray and place the dough on the tray, ensuring that the portions are not touching. Cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap lightly coated with oil. Leave out for 1 to 1½ hours, or until puffy, or refrigerate for up to 3 days. If you refrigerate the dough, use plastic wrap to cover it and expect it to take an hour or two to return to room temperature before it is ready to be rolled out.
Dust the counter lightly with flour. Pat a portion of dough into an oval with your fingertips. Using a rolling pin and moving back and forth, roll the dough as thinly as possible into an oval about 13 by 9 in [33 by 23 cm]. If the dough resists stretching, let it relax and start working on another portion before returning to it. You can also gently stretch the dough with your hands to correct the shape. It doesn’t have to look perfect.
Place a carbon-steel wok upside down over a burner. Have a pair of tongs handy.
Heat the wok over high heat for 1 minute or until a sprinkle of water instantly evaporates.
Drape the dough over the wok. Cook for 1 minute or until you can lift it easily from the wok with tongs and it has puffed slightly and blistered. Turn the dough over to briefly cook the other side, no more than 30 seconds. For extra browning, flip it over for another 30 seconds.
Transfer the lavash to a half-sheet pan and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you cook the rest of the dough. In between batches, turn off the burner. The wok heats up quickly, and it will get too hot if the burner is left on.
Place a 20 in [50 cm] cast-iron griddle over two burners. Heat the griddle over medium-high heat for a few minutes or until a sprinkle of water instantly evaporates.
Drape the dough over the griddle. Cook for 1 minute or until you can lift the dough easily with tongs and it has puffed slightly and blistered. Turn the dough over to briefly cook the other side, no more than 30 seconds. For extra browning, flip it over for 30 more seconds.
Transfer the lavash to a half-sheet pan and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you cook the rest of the dough. In between batches, keep the griddle turned on, but monitor its heat so it doesn’t get too hot.
Have tongs, a pastry brush, a small bowl of vegetable oil, and 2 half-sheet pans ready. Coat one of the pans lightly with oil.
Heat a gas grill over medium-high heat or prepare a charcoal grill for direct-heat cooking. Ensure that the grill grates are clean. The grill should be hot enough that you can only hold your hand over the grates for 3 to 5 seconds. Place a sheet of dough onto the oiled pan and brush oil on top. Drape the oiled dough over the grill. Cover the grill and cook for 25 seconds. Uncover the grill. Using tongs, turn the lavash over and let it cook for another 25 seconds, uncovered, or until evenly blistered and puffed in parts.
Transfer to the clean half-sheet pan and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you cook the rest of the dough.
Eat the lavash soon after making it or store it in plastic bags to keep the bread pliable. It’s okay if it dries out and turns brittle; just rehydrate it by misting the lavash with water and covering it with a towel to let it soften. Soon after, it should be pliable enough to roll up without cracking. If it’s still cracking, mist with more water.",lavash

"""Cold-Fry"" Frites","2 pounds (1 kg/about 4 large) russet potatoes, 2 1/2 quarts (2.5 l) vegetable oil, such as sunflower oil, at room temperature, Fine sea salt, A French-fry cutter (optional); 2 thick, clean kitchen towels; a 4- to 9-quart (4 to 9 l) heavy-duty saucepan or cast-iron pot; a kitchen timer; a wire skimmer or slotted metal spoon; 2 trays lined with paper towels; a warmed platter.","Title: ""Cold-Fry"" Frites
Instructions: Rinse the potatoes, peel them, rinse again, and cut lengthwise into 3/8-inch (10 mm) fries. (Precision is not essential here: I love the tiny, crunchy, almost-burned bits that emerge from the fryer.)
Soak the potatoes in a bowl of cold water for about 5 minutes, changing the water when it becomes cloudy (at least twice), until the water remains clear. (Soaking releases the starch in potatoes, making them less rigid and less likely to stick together while cooking.)
Drain the potatoes and wrap them in the kitchen towels to dry. (Removing the excess liquid will speed up the cooking time and reduce the likelihood of the potatoes splattering once the oil is hot.)
Transfer the potatoes to the saucepan and set it over the stove. Pour the oil over the potatoes. Do not cover the pot. Set the heat to high, stirring the potatoes gently with a metal spoon to distribute and prevent sticking. (A metal spoon lets you feel if any potato bits are stuck to the bottom of the pan and scrape them up.)
The oil should move from a peppy simmer to a boil in about 9 minutes. When the oil starts to boil, set a timer for 17 minutes. Stir the potatoes very gently every 3 to 4 minutes to prevent sticking and ensure even cooking. Don’t worry about overboiling—the oil should boil rapidly and evenly with no need to adjust the heat throughout the entire process.
When the timer rings, the potatoes should have begun to take on color, turning from white to slightly golden, but will still have about 4 minutes remaining until they are fully cooked. For these last few minutes, watch them closely, stirring gently. When the fries are a deep golden brown, taste one to make sure they are truly crisp and firm on the outside with a creamy interior. They should not be the least bit soggy, so resist the urge to remove them from the oil too soon. When you are happy with the consistency, carefully transfer the rest of the fries with the wire skimmer or slotted spoon to the paper-towel-lined trays to drain. Season with salt and serve immediately on the warmed platter.
Use firm, fresh potatoes. Rinse and soak them well to rid them of starch. The less starch in the potatoes, the crispier the fries will be.
To keep the oil well contained in the pot, make sure there is at least 2 inches (5 cm) of room from the top of the oil to the rim of the pot.
We have made these fries in varied quantities with proportionate quantities of oil and pot size: 1 pound (500 g) potatoes/1 1/2 quarts (1.5 l) oil/4-quart (4 l) pot 2 pounds (1 kg) potatoes/2 1/2 quarts (2.5 l) oil/5- to 7-quart (5 to 7 l) pot 3 pounds (1.5 kg) potatoes/3 quarts (3 l) oil/7-quart (7 l) pot 4 pounds (2 kg) potatoes/4 quarts (4 l) oil/8- to 9-quart (8 to 9 l) pot
Do not use an aluminum pot; it will not hold the heat in the same manner as a heavy cast-iron or stainless steel pot, and the results may not be satisfactory.

Preheat oven to 450°F. Arrange 3 1/2 pounds turkey wings and 1 turkey neck (optional) on a rimmed baking sheet and roast, turning turkey halfway through, until golden brown, about 45 minutes.
Transfer wings and neck to a stockpot. Pour off fat from baking sheet; discard. Pour 2 cups water onto baking sheet. Scrape up any browned bits with a wooden spoon. Pour liquid from sheet into pot with turkey. Add 1 chopped large onion, 1 peeled and chopped large carrot, 1 chopped celery stalk, 4 sprigs parsley, 4 sprigs thyme, 12 whole peppercorns, 1 bay leaf, and 10 cups water. Bring to a simmer; reduce heat to low and simmer gently until stock is reduced by at least one-third, about 4 hours.
Strain stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean saucepan. If you have more than 6 cups stock, simmer uncovered over medium heat until reduced to 6 cups. Let cool. Pour stock into an airtight container; cover and chill. DO AHEAD: Stock can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled. Stock can also be frozen for up to 3 months.
Roux is simply butter or oil cooked with flour. It's used for thickening sauces, and it's what makes this gravy silky-smooth.
Melt 1/3 cup unsalted butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Whisk in 1/3 cup all-purpose flour. Reduce heat to low; whisk until roux is golden brown, about 2 minutes. DO AHEAD: Roux can be made 2 days ahead. Let cool, cover, and chill.
Browned bits left in the bottom of the pan after roasting the turkey give body, richness, and roasty flavor to the gravy.
Bring 6 cups Make-Ahead Turkey Stock to a boil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add 1-2 cups skimmed and strained roast turkey drippings. (If you're short on drippings, skim fat from pan and add 1-2 cups water. Scrape up browned bits with a wooden spoon; strain liquid into stock.) Season to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Whisk in roux. Reduce heat to low; simmer gently for 5 minutes for gravy to thicken and flavors to meld. You're done!",gravy-51122830

Instructions: To make the “beet water,” roughly chop 2 pounds of the beets (select the smaller ones), preferably in a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Place the chopped beets in a large stockpot. Add 10 cups of water and 1 tablespoon vinegar.
Place the stockpot over high heat and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 2 hours. (If it seems like the liquid is evaporating too quickly, you may need to cover the pot partially with an offset lid.) The beets should be extremely soft and the liquid bright red.
Strain the liquid, pressing the cooked beets against the side of the strainer to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the pulp or reserve. Set aside the beet water. You should have just about 4 cups.
Meanwhile, place the remaining 1 pound of whole beets in a separate large stockpot. Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the beets are tender-firm, about 40 minutes. When the beets are cooked, add 1 tablespoon white vinegar and set them aside to cool.
When the whole cooked beets are cool enough to handle, peel them; the skins should slip off easily. Grate the peeled beets on the largest holes of a box grater or in a food processor fitted with the grating blade.
To make the broth, place the pork butt in a large stockpot and add the beef stock. If necessary, add a little more stock or water to cover. Add the bay leaf, allspice berries, and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the meat is tender and beginning to fall apart, about 2 hours. Set the pork aside to cool. When the pork is cool enough to handle, remove it from the pot and cut the meat into ½-inch cubes. Strain the broth and discard the bay leaf, allspice berries, and peppercorns. Reserve the cubed meat and 4 cups of the broth.
To cook the vegetables, place the carrots and celery in a large stockpot and pour the reserved meat broth over them. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the carrots and celery are just tender, about 8 minutes. Add the cabbage and potatoes and continue to cook until the potatoes and carrots are easily pierced with a pairing knife but keep their shape, 15 to 20 additional minutes. Add the lima beans and cook for 5 additional minutes, just to meld the flavors. Gradually add the remaining 7 tablespoons white vinegar, tasting between additions and stopping when the flavor is to your liking. Remove the soup from the heat and set aside.
To compose the soup, in a large soup pot combine the “beet water” and meat broth with the vegetables. Add the cubed pork and the grated beets. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer over low heat. Season to taste with salt and serve immediately.",veselkas-famous-borscht

"Zucchini-Wrapped Halibut ""Scallops""","1 teaspoon smoked paprika, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 2 teaspoons curry powder, 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper, 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, 1 tablespoon honey, 1 teaspoon water, 1 teaspoon dark brown sugar, 1 large zucchini, 1 pound halibut, fillets cut into 1-inch cubes (see note), Toothpicks, ""1 pound spinach (I use the whole thing, stems and leaves, because Im lazy)"", 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, 1 shallot, finely diced, 2 teaspoons all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1/4 cup dry white wine, 1 pound dry fettuccine, Vegetable oil, Olive oil, for drizzling","Title: Zucchini-Wrapped Halibut ""Scallops""
Instructions: To prep, mix the ingredients for the two rubs and the glaze in 3 separate bowls. Then, using a vegetable peeler, start peeling along the length of the zucchini, beginning with the green outer layer, creating 1/2-inch-thick ribbons. Rotate the zucchini a quarter-turn after each peel in order to make somewhat even-sized ribbons. Make as many as possible and stop when you get to the seeds. Lay the ribbons out on a plate and sprinkle the zucchini rub on both sides, spreading gently it with your hands until all of the pieces are covered. It doesn't have to be an even coating, but you want every ribbon to have some color and spice.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
Dip the halibut chunks into the scallop rub, making sure they are coated on all sides. Tightly wrap a zucchini ribbon around a halibut cube like a belt, so that the ends overlap. Use a toothpick to secure the zucchini and push it through to the other side. Place the wrapped halibut on a plate and repeat the procedure with the remaining fish and zucchini ribbons.
Now it's time to start on your sauce. Add the spinach to the boiling pot of water and cook for 1 minute. Immediately remove the spinach from the water with a slotted spoon, reserving the cooking liquid, and transfer the spinach to a colander to drain. Rinse with cold water and when cool to the touch, use your hands to tightly squeeze the spinach and wring out the liquid. Do this 4 to 5 times until no water remains. Finely chop the spinach into little green bits and set aside.
In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook for 2 minutes. Then add the flour and whisk until combined, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the cream and whisk until the sauce begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Add the wine and the chopped spinach and continue to cook for 5 more minutes. The sauce will look thick, like creamed spinach. Reduce the heat to the lowest setting to keep the sauce warm.
Reheat the water you used to cook the spinach, and bring to a boil. Make sure you have your halibut rounds, the glaze, a plate, a large sheet of foil, and your serving bowl ready to go, because you are about to be moving around your kitchen quickly.
Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook for 10 minutes or according to the instructions on the package. While the pasta is cooking, heat 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil over medium heat in a large skillet (nonstick if possible). When the oil starts to hiss and sizzle, place the halibut pieces in the pan in a single layer and cook for 2 minutes. Evenly spread the glaze on the top of the fish and then flip the halibut rounds, cooking the other side for 2 minutes more. Spread more glaze on the top side again, flip, and cook for a final 1 to 2 minutes. The halibut will have a crisp, brown sear on both sides. Put the cooked fish on a clean plate and cover it with foil to keep warm. If you had to split the fish into two batches, repeat until all the halibut rounds are cooked.
Finally, drain the pasta and put it into a large bowl with a drizzle of olive oil so the noodles don't stick together. Add the warm spinach sauce to the pasta and toss.
To serve, make a nest of the sauced noodles on a plate and top with 4 or 5 ""scallops"" per guest. Remove the toothpicks and dig in.",zucchini-wrapped-halibut-scallops-51171810

Instructions: Process all ingredients in a food processor until as smooth as possible.
You should have about 4 cups. Reserve 2 cups for the sauce, and set aside the remainder.
Puree all the ingredients in a high-speed blender until smooth.
Using a mandoline, slice the beets very thin (so they are pliable and not stiff, approximately 1/16 of an inch or less).
Make small stacks of the larger pieces and use a sharp knife to cut into squares-the size doesn't matter much, as long as they are all roughly the same. Alternatively, use a round-, heart-or other- shaped cookie cutter to cut the slices. Cut at least 40 slices-10 per serving, with a few extra to spare.
In a medium bowl, place the beet slices, oil, lemon juice, and salt and toss gently to coat evenly. Allowing the beets to sit for a half hour or more will soften them; this is optional but a good idea if your slices are on the thicker side and still a bit stiff.
Lay half the beet slices on a clean work surface and top each with a rounded teaspoonful of the cheese. Top with the remaining beet slices and press down gently.

Instructions: Wash jars, lids, and screw bands in hot, soapy water, then rinse well. Dry screw bands. Put jars on a rack in canner or deep pot and add enough water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil, covered, then boil for 10 minutes. Remove from heat, leaving jars in water. Heat lids in water to cover by 2 inches in a small saucepan until thermometer registers 180°F (do not let boil). Remove from heat, leaving lids in water. Keep the jars and lids submerged in hot water, covered, until ready to use.
Chill 2 small plates (for testing jam).
Slip skins from grapes and purée skins with 1 cup sugar in a food processor, then transfer to a 4- to 6-quart wide heavy pot. Stir in lemon juice, peeled grapes, and remaining 4 cups sugar and boil over moderate heat, stirring frequently and skimming foam, until pulp is broken down, about 20 minutes. Force jam through food mill set over a large bowl. Discard remaining solids. Return jam to pot and cook at a slow boil, skimming foam occasionally and stirring frequently as mixture thickens to prevent scorching, 35 minutes, then test for doneness.
To test jam, remove from heat, then drop a teaspoonful on a chilled plate and chill 1 minute. Tilt plate: Jam should remain in a mound and not run. If jam runs, continue cooking at a slow boil, testing every 5 minutes, until done, up to 25 minutes more.
Drain jars upside down on a clean kitchen towel 1 minute, then invert. Ladle jam into jars, leaving 1/4 inch of space at top. Wipe off rims of filled jars with a clean damp kitchen towel, then top with lids and firmly screw on screw bands. Put sealed jars on rack in canner or pot and add enough water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil, covered, then boil 10 minutes. With tongs, transfer jars to a towel-lined surface to cool.
Jars will seal; if you hear a ping, it signals that vacuum formed at the top of cooling preserves has made lid concave. Remember that you may or may not be around to hear that ping (some jars make the sound after you remove them from water, and others in same batch may take a few hours); the important thing is for jars to eventually have concave lids. Preserves will thicken as they cool.
After jars have cooled 12 to 24 hours, press center of each lid to check that it's concave, then remove screw band and try to lift off lid with your fingertips. If you can't, lid has a good seal. Replace screw band. Put any jars that haven't sealed properly in the refrigerator and use them first.",concord-grape-jam-232813

Jerk Tofu Wrapped in Collard Leaves,"1 cup chopped yellow onion, 3 scallions, thinly sliced, 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger, 1 tablespoon minced garlic, 2 tablespoons muscovado sugar, 1 tablespoon ground allspice, 1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper, Pinch of cayenne pepper, 2 Scotch bonnet or habanero chiles, stemmed, seeded, and minced, 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice, 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, 6 tablespoons shoyu, ¼ cup coconut oil, 2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme, Fine sea salt, ¾ cup olive oil, 16 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced, 2 garlic cloves, minced, 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, ¼ teaspoon ground coriander, ¼ teaspoon coarse sea salt, plus more as needed, 1 cup tightly packed fresh cilantro leaves, 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, ½ jalapeño, 2 (14-to 16-ounce) blocks extra-firm tofu, 2 cups Jerk Marinade, 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons fine sea salt, plus more as needed, 16 large collard leaves, tough part of the stem removed, 1 cup arrowroot powder, Peanut oil, for frying, ¼ cup Garlic Chips, Cilantro Sauce, Cilantro leaves, for garnish, Crushed peanuts, for garnish","Title: Jerk Tofu Wrapped in Collard Leaves
Instructions: Combine all the ingredients except the salt in a food processor, add ¼ cup water, and puree until well combined. Season with salt to taste. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use, up to 1 week.
In a medium skillet, warm the olive oil over low heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until crispy and golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Strain the oil through fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, reserving the garlic chips. Use immediately or store in separate airtight containers in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
In a small skillet, combine the garlic, olive oil, coriander, and salt. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook just until the garlic is fragrant, about 1 ½ minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool.
Transfer the oil mixture to a blender. Add the cilantro, lemon juice, jalapeño, and ¼ cup water and blend until smooth. If necessary, season with additional salt to taste. Use immediately or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
First, press your tofu. This procedure extracts excess water, makes the block more uniformly firm, and allows the tofu to absorb the marinade more easily. Just wrap the block of tofu in a clean kitchen towel (or paper towels), place it in a large bowl or a clean kitchen sink, and sit something heavy on top of it (like a 28-ounce can of tomatoes) for 20 minutes, turning the block over after 15 minutes.
Place one block of the tofu on a cutting board. Cut it in half horizontally, then cut vertically down the center to yield four pieces. Repeat with the second block of tofu.
Pour the marinade into a large baking dish, adding just enough water to ensure that it is runny, if necessary. Place the tofu in the marinade in one even layer. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight, flipping the tofu every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours. Remove the tofu from the marinade, scrape off any excess, and transfer to a large plate. Strain the marinade through a fine-mesh sieve and set aside.
In a large pot, bring 2 quarts water to a boil over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the salt. Blanch the collard leaves, one at a time, for 30 seconds each, then lay them flat on clean kitchen towels to dry.
Combine the arrowroot and the remaining 2 tea¬spoons salt in a pie plate. Mix well. Coat each side of the tofu pieces with the arrowroot, shake off any excess arrowroot, and transfer them to a second large plate.
Lightly coat the bottom of a large cast-iron skillet with peanut oil and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add half the tofu and fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Gently flip each piece with a spatula and fry until golden brown on the second side. Lightly sprinkle both sides of the tofu with salt and transfer to a rack. Repeat to fry the remaining tofu. Wipe the skillet clean.
On a clean work surface, arrange two collard leaves lengthwise, overlapping each other by an inch or so, and place one piece of tofu in the center of the leaves. Smear 2 heaping tablespoons of the reserved marinade on top of the tofu, sprinkle a heaping teaspoon of garlic chips on top of the tofu, then fold the leaves around the tofu to create a packet. Repeat with the remaining collard leaves and tofu.
In the same skillet, warm 2 tablespoons peanut oil over medium-high heat, tilting the pan to coat it evenly with the oil. Place the packets in the skillet, folded-side up, and cook for about 1 minute. Gently flip each packet with a spatula, cover the skillet with a lid or some aluminum foil, and cook for about 5 minutes to warm through.
To serve, spread some cilantro sauce over four plates and place two of the tofu packets on each plate. Garnish with cilantro leaves and peanuts and serve.",jerk-tofu-wrapped-in-collard-leaves-bryant-terry-vegetable-kingdom

Instructions: Preheat oven to 350°. Heat butter in a large ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Cook shallots, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, 8–10 minutes. Add pepper, 1 teaspoon salt, and 2 tablespoons vinegar and toss. Roast shallots in oven, checking after 10 minutes and shaking pan to turn and adding a splash or so of water if butter is burning, until tender, 10–20 minutes.
Meanwhile, whisk oil, chile, and remaining 1/4 cup vinegar in a large bowl; season with salt (vinaigrette will separate as it sits).
When shallots are done cooking, whisk vinaigrette, add shallots, and toss gently.

Monkey Bread,"1 cup (2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces, plus more for bowl, 1/3 cup whole milk, 1 1/4-ounce envelope active dry yeast (about 2 1/4 tsp.), 3 cups (or more) all-purpose flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 teaspoons kosher salt, 4 large eggs, room temperature, 3/4 cup granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, slightly cooled, plus more for pan, Sanding or granulated sugar (for pan), Prepared caramel sauce (for serving), A 10-inch tube pan or 10-cup Bundt pan","Title: Monkey Bread
Instructions: Beat 1 cup butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-low speed until butter is smooth and pliable but still cold, about 1 minute. Scrape into a medium bowl; set aside. Save mixer bowl because you’re going to use it again in a minute (no need to wash).
Gently heat milk in a small saucepan over low until warm to the touch but not steaming hot. It should be 110°F–115°F. Whisk milk and yeast in a small bowl to dissolve yeast, then let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, whisk flour, sugar, and salt in reserved mixer bowl to combine. Add yeast mixture and eggs, fit bowl back onto mixer, and beat on low speed with dough hook, gradually increasing mixer speed to medium as dry ingredients are incorporated, until dough comes together around hook. Continue to mix on medium speed until dough is smooth, elastic, and no longer sticking to the sides of the bowl, about 5 minutes. Add more flour by the tablespoonful as needed if dough isn’t pulling away from bowl cleanly.
With motor running, gradually add reserved butter about a tablespoonful at a time, waiting until it is absorbed before adding more. This process can take several minutes, so be patient. When you’re done adding the butter, the dough will be extremely smooth, soft, and supple but not sticky. Place dough in a large buttered bowl and cover. Let sit in a warm, draft-free spot until nearly doubled in size, 55–65 minutes.
Uncover dough and punch down several times to deflate. Line a 13x9"" baking dish with plastic wrap, leaving generous overhang on all sides. Place dough in pan and press into an even layer, working all the way to the sides of the pan. Fold plastic up and over dough, eliminating air pockets between dough and plastic. Chill dough in freezer until firm to the touch, 20–30 minutes.
Mix granulated sugar and cinnamon in a medium bowl to combine. Lightly brush tube pan with butter. Sprinkle with sanding sugar, tapping out excess; set aside. Remove dough from freezer and peel back plastic. Brush entire surface with melted butter and sprinkle generously with some cinnamon sugar. Shake excess sugar back into bowl, then invert baking pan and turn out dough onto work surface sugar side down. Remove plastic; discard. Brush other side of dough with butter and sprinkle with more cinnamon sugar. Use a pizza cutter or a chef’s knife to cut dough into a 12x6 grid.
Working relatively quickly so dough doesn’t become too soft, separate pieces and, working one at a time, roll lightly between your palms into balls, dusting with more cinnamon sugar as needed to prevent sticking. Place in prepared tube pan as you go. Cover pan with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm, draft-free spot until pieces have swelled to nearly doubled in size, 40–50 minutes. Preheat oven to 350° a little before monkey bread is ready to bake.
Remove plastic from pan and bake monkey bread until golden brown, 25–35 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes, then use a small offset spatula to loosen monkey bread from sides of pan. Pull bottom out from pan and use spatula to loosen bread from bottom. Slide bread back into pan; invert onto a plate and remove pan. Place a wire rack over bread and invert right side up onto rack. If using a Bundt pan, just invert directly onto wire rack. Let cool at least 15 minutes before serving.
Pour about 1/2 cup caramel sauce over monkey bread if desired. Serve with more sauce alongside for dipping.
Dough can be made 1 day ahead. After punching down, pat into plastic-lined pan and chill in refrigerator instead of freezer.",caramel-cinnamon-monkey-bread

Instructions: Season pork with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium. Cook pork, turning often, until evenly browned, 10–12 minutes. Transfer to a platter and pour off pan drippings.
Wipe out any burned bits from pot, but leave the golden-brown pieces (doing this will keep the finished sauce from tasting bitter). Add onion and garlic to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is starting to brown and caramelize, 12–15 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly darkened in color, 5–8 minutes.
Add wine and cook, scraping up any browned bits, until reduced by about half, 5–8 minutes.
Add tomatoes, crushing with your hands as you go, then add thyme, rosemary, and bay leaves; stir in 2 cups water. Add pork with any juices accumulated on the platter; season with salt and pepper.
Bring liquid to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, until pork is falling-apart tender, sauce is thickened (it will be thicker than a typical pasta sauce), and flavors have melded, 2 1/2–3 hours.

Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Lightly butter the inside of a 9-inch (23-cm) springform pan.
Make the crust: Crumble the crackers and cookies into a medium bowl. Use a pestle or the bottom of a heavy bottle to crush them into fine crumbs. Add ⅓ cup (75 ml) of the condensed milk and stir until very well combined. (You can grind the crumbled graham crackers and mix them with the condensed milk in a food processor if you prefer.) Press the crumb mixture firmly and evenly into the bottom of the pan. Bake until the crust looks a little darker and smells sweet and toasty, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool the crust in the pan on a wire rack.
One at a time, cut an avocado in half lengthwise. Twist the halves to separate them. Hold the half with the pit in one hand. Holding the knife in your other hand, rap the knife blade into the pit to lodge it there. Twist the knife to loosen and remove the pit. Use a large spoon to scoop the avocado flesh onto a chopping board, discarding the skins. Coarsely chop the avocados.
Add the chopped avocados, cream cheese, remaining condensed milk, and salt to a food processor. (You can combine the filling in a blender instead but you may need to work in batches.) Grate the zest of 1 lemon and set aside. Squeeze the zested lemon and the limes (you should have about ⅓ cup/75 ml lemon), reserving the remaining lemon for garnish. Add the juice to the avocados and process the mixture until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.
Spread the filling in the cooled crust and sprinkle with the grated lemon zest. Cover the pan and freeze until the filling is firm, at least 6 hours or preferably overnight.
Let the frozen cake stand at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before slicing. Dipping a thin knife into hot water between each cut, slice the cake into wedges and serve, topping each serving with freshly grated lemon zest.",frozen-avocado-cake-nadine-levy-redzepi
Kiwi Ice Pop,4 kiwi fruits,"Title: Kiwi Ice Pop
Instructions: Top and tail the kiwis. To peel them, gently push a teaspoon under the skin of the kiwi and follow the inside of the skin until it reaches about halfway downthe fruit. Revolve the spoon in a circular motion around the flesh of the kiwi so that the flesh is separated from the skin.
Remove the teaspoon, turn the kiwi the other way up and apply the same technique until the flesh is entirely separate from the skin. Carefully push the base of the flesh of the kiwi out of the skin. It should slip out fairly easily. If necessary nick the skin with a knife.
Slice the kiwi crosswise into two or three thick slices. The intricate pattern of the middle of the kiwi should be on show on the cross section. Slowly insert a lollipop stick into the edge of the kiwi until it reaches the middle.
Put the kiwi slices into a container and place in the freezer, with a little bit of space around them so that they don’t stick together. Freeze for at least 3 hours.
Before serving, remove from the freezer and allow to rest at room temperature for 5 minutes",kiwi-ice-pop

Instructions: If using dried peas, soak them overnight in 3 cups of water. Drain. Bring 3 fresh cups of water to a boil in a saucepan and add the peas. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until cooked almost completely through. Drain and set aside. If using canned beans, drain, rinse with cold water, drain again, and set aside. Wash the rice by placing it in a colander or fine-mesh sieve and running cold water over it until the water runs clear, about 1 minute. Drain well and set aside.
Heat the oil over medium heat in a Dutch oven or other heavy, deep pot. Add the sugar and swirl in the pot, stirring constantly; allow it to caramelize to a dark brown color. Add the chicken and stir well to coat. Add the onion and garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
Stir in 2 cups of water, the coconut milk, bay leaf, Green Seasoning, parsley, thyme, carrots, and scallions. Season with salt. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.
Stir the rice, squash, peas, hot pepper, ketchup, and butter into the chicken. Cover and cook for 20 minutes, or until the peas and vegetables are tender. Remove lid and fluff the rice. The rice should be moist but not sticky. Remove bay leaf, thyme sprig, and hot pepper.
Note: Pigeon peas are traditional in this dish, but pinto beans or black-eyes peas also work well because, like pigeon peas, they hold their shape well after cooking. Brown sugar is preferable for deeper flavor and color. Chicken is the most common meat in pelau, but cuts of stew beef or lamb work just as well. If using meat, up the cooking time before adding the rice to 40 minutes to allow the meat to get tender. In Tobago, pelau is often made with crab. West Indian pumpkin (also called calabaza) is ideal for this recipe, although the pie or ""cheese"" pumpkin common in the U.S., if in season, makes a very good substitute. Butternut squash will also work, although it will be slightly less sweet.",pelau-234498

Pizza Dough,"1 1/4 cups warm water (95°), One 1/4-ounce package active dry yeast, 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar, 3 1/2 cups of ""00"" flour, Scant 2 tablespoons salt, 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, Semolina for dusting","Title: Pizza Dough
Instructions: Whisk the warm water, yeast, and sugar together in a bowl. Let stand in a warm place for 10 minutes, or until the yeast is foamy.
Combine the flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and mix well. With the mixer on low, add the yeast mixture and oil, mixing well. Continue to mix, gradually increasing the mixer speed to medium-high, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and give it a few turns by hand to finish kneading it; it will still be slightly sticky.
Alternatively, combine the flour and salt in a large bowl and whisk together. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the yeast mixture and oil. Using a wooden spoon, stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until the mixture is too stiff to stir, then mix with your hands in the bowl until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto the lightly floured work surface and knead, adding only as much flour as necessary to prevent sticking, until smooth elastic, and only slightly sticky. Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl, turning to coat, cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until doubled in size.
Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a well-floured work surface. Divide it into 8 pieces (about 4 ounces each) and shape each one into a ball. Cover with a tea towel and let stand for 15 minutes before stretching the dough. Or, for easier handling, transfer the balls to a floured baking sheet and refrigerate until cold.
Dust a large work surface with a mixture of flour and semolina. If the dough has been refrigerated, transfer one ball to work surface and let stand just until still cool but not cold ( about 60°F if tested with an instant-read thermometer).
Meanwhile, preheat the griddle pan over medium heat until very hot, about 5 minutes (at the restaurant, we use a digital infrared thermometer to gauge the temperature of the griddle, which, ideally, should be 375°F).
Using your hands, begin to press and stretch the dough into a 9- to 10- inch round, adding only enough additional flour and semolina to the work surface to keep the dough from sticking; using one hand as a guide, slope a slightly thicker rim all around the circle of dough. Work quickly, and be careful not to overwork the dough; if it resists or shrinks back as you shape it, let it rest briefly before proceeding. (If you prefer, you can roll out the dough with a rolling pin. Lightly flour the work surface and the rolling pin; sprinkle the rolling pin with more flour as necessary to prevent sticking.)
Carefully place the dough round on the pre-heated griddle pan and cook until barely tan on the first side and browned in a few spots, 2 to 3 minutes. As the crust cooks, if you see any parts that remain undercooked, especially any thicker parts, simply press them against the pan so they cook a bit more; once the dough has set, you can move the crust around as necessary for more even cooking. Flip the crust over and cook until the second side is completely dry, about 1 minute longer.
Transfer the crust to a wire rack or baking sheet, brushing off any excess flour, and allow to cool. Repeat with the remaining dough. (The parbaked crusts can be refrigerated overnight or frozen, well wrapped, for up to 2 weeks. Sometimes when you go through the effort of preparing all these steps, it might be work making more than you want to eat and then, depending on the toppings, freezing the extra finished pizzas. Occasionally I'll come home on a Sunday night and reheat a frozen pizza I made on Friday in the toaster oven—a great snack in less than 10 minutes, with absolutely no effort.)
We recommend making only one pizza at a time and serving each one as soon as it is done. If you need to make a lot for a large party, cook several of them once (slightly undercook them) and then reheat them in a warm oven before serving.
Place the parbaked pizza crust on a pizza peel or baking sheet. Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the crust, leaving a 1/2 inch border all around, and top with any remaining ingredients as specified in the individual recipe. (Do not put the sauce and any other ingredients on the pizza crust until ready to broil it, or the crust may become soggy.)
Slide the pizza under the broiler, about 4 inches from the heat source, and broil for 7 or 8 minutes (or as otherwise noted in the individual recipe), until the topping ingredients are heated and/or cooked through and crust is charred and blistered in spots. Watch closely so that the ingredients don't burn, and move the pizza around or lower the broiler rack if necessary. (Sometimes during this stage, depending on the topping, the bottom may start to become soggy; if that happens, you can simply slip the pizza back onto the griddle momentarily to recrisp the crust.) And, if you prefer more color—as we do!—move the pizza closer to the heat source at the very end.
Finish the pizza with any remaining ingredients, as described in the individual recipe, and cut into slices with a pizza wheel, kitchen shears, or a very sharp knife. Serve hot.",pizza-dough-358471

Instructions: In a small bowl, combine the garlic, salt, brown sugar, smoked paprika, chile powder, black pepper, sage, thyme, dry mustard, cumin, coriander, ginger, and cayenne pepper if using. Generously coat the ribs with the rub then wrap each slab in a double layer of plastic wrap and let them sit at room temperature for up to 2 hours. DO AHEAD: To develop maximum flavor, place the ribs, coated in the rub, in the refrigerator and chill at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours.
Preheat the oven to 325°F.
Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil. If you have a flat metal cooling rack, arrange it in the baking sheet and place the ribs, bone side down, on the rack. If you don't have a rack, place the ribs, bone side down, directly on the foil-lined baking sheet. Bake the ribs until the meat is tender and starting to pull away from the bones, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. At this point, the ribs are ready to be served, but we recommend taking the time to finish them on the grill (or in the broiler), while glazing with homemade barbecue sauce. DO AHEAD: Ribs can be baked ahead of time and kept, wrapped in foil, at room temperature for 4 to 6 hours, before finishing them on the grill.
In a heavy, medium saucepan over moderately low heat, cook the bacon until the fat renders and the bacon starts to brown, about 10 minutes—do not let the bacon get crispy. Add the onions and continue cooking, covered and stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, sage, and thyme and cook, stirring occasionally, for 1 minute. Add the smoked paprika, chile powder, cumin, black pepper, and ginger and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the coffee, brown sugar, yellow mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and vinegar and stir well to combine. Raise the heat to moderate and bring the sauce to a boil, scraping the saucepan with a wooden spoon to remove any browned bits from the bottom. Add the ketchup, hot sauce, and bay leaves, then lower the heat to moderately low and simmer the sauce until it's thick enough to coat the back of a spoon but isn't as thick as ketchup, about 30 minutes. Taste the sauce and add more vinegar or hot sauce to taste and season with salt and pepper. Remove and discard the bay leaves. DO AHEAD: BBQ sauce can be made ahead and stored, in an airtight container in the refrigerator, up to 2 weeks. Warm the sauce gently on the stove before using.
While the barbecue sauce is simmering, prepare your grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-high heat: If using a charcoal grill, open the vents on the bottom of the grill and light a large chimney starter full of charcoal (preferably hardwood). When the coals are covered with white-gray ash (about 20 to 30 minutes later), spread them out on the grill's bottom rack, leaving a space to one side that is equal to the size of the food to be grilled so that it can be moved there in the case of flare-ups. Test the heat of the charcoal by holding your hand 5 inches above the coals for about 3 seconds for medium-high heat. If the charcoal is too hot, continue to let it burn until it reaches medium-high.
If using a gas grill, preheat all burners on high, covered, for 10 minutes, then adjust the heat to medium-high.
Depending on the size of your grill, place 1 or 2 slabs, bone side down, over the heat and brush the fat-covered side generously with barbecue sauce. Grill the ribs, covered, for 2 minutes. Flip the slab over, brush the bone side with sauce, and grill, covered, until the sauce on the fat-covered side is caramelized and lightly charred, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the slab over and continue grilling, covered, until the sauce on the bone side is caramelized and lightly charred, 1 minute. Transfer the ribs to a cutting board and let them rest for 10 minutes. If necessary, repeat the grilling and glazing process with the second slab of ribs. Cut between the ribs and serve immediately with plenty of barbecue sauce on the side.",classic-barbecue-pork-ribs-with-smoky-bacon-barbecue-sauce-51177000

"Neo-Classical Thanksgiving Dressing with Apricots and Prunes, Stuffed in a Whole Pumpkin","1 cup dried apricots, 1 cup dried pitted prunes, 1 cup apple juice, 1 loaf good-quality commercially made presliced whole wheat bread, 1 large onion, diced, 1 to 2 stalks leafy celery, diced (leaves included), 1 1/2 teaspoons to 1 tablespoon dried leaf (not ground) sage, 1/4 cup butter, melted, Vegetable stock (see tip, below) as needed, Tamari or shoyu soy sauce to taste, A small amount of dried leaf basil and oregano to taste (optional), Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste, Cooking spray (optional), 1 medium-large pumpkin, preferably one of the buff-colored pumpkins, prepared as follows:","Title: Neo-Classical Thanksgiving Dressing with Apricots and Prunes, Stuffed in a Whole Pumpkin
Instructions: Cut off and reserve a lid, as you would preparatory to carving a jack-o'-lantern. Scoop out all of the seeds and fibers. Put an inch or two of water in a large pot. Place the pumpkin, cut side down, in the water, cap wedged in near it. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover tightly and team for 10 to 15 minutes to precook slightly. Remove the pot from the heat and let cool. When cool, remove from the pot. Since the pumpkin will be eaten with the stuffing, I like to season the inside with salt, pepper, a little tamari, Pickapeppa, and brown sugar, rubbing this into the exposed interior flesh after steaming.
1. Place the apricots and prunes in a small, heatproof bowl. Place the apple juice in a small saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil. Immediately pour the juice over the dried fruit. Let stand for at least 2 hours, but overnight or a day or two in advance is fine. Drain the dried fruit, reserving both the fruit and the soaking liquid. Coarsely chop the fruit and set aside.
2. Preheat the oven to 375°F, then turn down to 200°F.
3. Set a wire rack on a baking sheet and place a single layer of bread slices on the rack. Place in the preheated oven and bake, slowly, turning once, until the bread is hard, crunchy, and dry all the way through, but not browned. This is a fairly slow process — it might take 45 to 60 minutes, but set the timer at 20-minute intervals to remind you to check. You with either need to do 2 sheets' worth of bread (in which case, reverse their positions in the oven halfway through), or repeat the toasting process again until all bread is prepared. Remove the dry bread from the oven and let cool.
4. Coarsely crumble the bread into a large bowl. Add the onion and leafy celery and toss to combine. Measure the sage (starting with the smaller amount) into your hands and rub the leaves back and forth in your palms until they crumble (this releases the volatile essential oils). Add the sage to the bread mixture. Pour the melted butter over the mixture and toss well to combine. Add the soaked dried fruit and toss again. The dressing should still be dry. Begin adding the liquid, a combination of vegetable stock and the reserved fruit soaking liquid. Use more stock than juice, and use just enough to moisten the dressing without making it soggy. Keep tossing, adding stock as needed. Add tamari, starting with about 1 tablespoon. Taste for salt and add it and plenty of pepper to taste. More sage, maybe? This is also the point at which you can add a little dried basil and oregano, too, if you like. The stuffing can be prepared up to this point and stored, covered and refrigerated, overnight.
5. On the day you plan to stuff the pumpkin, preheat the oven to 375°F.
6. If not using nonstick, spray a baking dish large enough to accommodate the pumpkin with cooking spray.
7. Stuff the dressing into the cavity of the prepared pumpkin, topping with the pumpkin's cap. Place the stuffed pumpkin in the prepared baking dish. Place in the preheated oven and bake until the pumpkin is slightly brown and looks a bit collapsed in on itself, or, as Ned says, like a plump European duchess, about 40 minutes.

Sumac and Saffron Refresher,"15 to 20 saffron strands, plus a few extra strands for garnish, ½ cup (100 g) sugar, 3 green cardamom pods, smashed, ¼ cup (30 g) ground sumac, 3 cups (700 ml) chilled club soda or water","Title: Sumac and Saffron Refresher
Instructions: Grind the saffron with 2 Tbsp. of sugar to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle.
In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine 1 cup (240 ml) water, sugar, cardamom, and powdered saffron mixture and bring to simmer, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and stir in the sumac. Cover the saucepan with a lid and let it steep for 30 minutes, no more. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh strainer over a medium bowl and chill before ready to serve.
To serve, fill four tall glasses with ice. In a large pitcher, stir the syrup with the chilled club soda or water. Pour 1 cup (120 ml) of the drink into each glass. Garnish each glass with 1 or 2 saffron strands. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
Sumac is rich in citric, malic, and tartaric acids but also bitter tannins. Steeping it in water dissolves the water-soluble acids. Gallotannin, one of the main tannins present in sumac, is bitter to taste and dissolves in water easily. Avoid steeping the sumac for too long or its tannins will make the syrup bitter. Saffron is ground to a fine powder using a little sugar as an abrasive. Grinding saffron increases the amount of color and flavor extracted than would be achieved if the strands were used directly. Club soda if used, adds a second note of acidity from the carbonic acid as well as the crackling sound of bubbles that create a sensation via chemesthesis.",sumac-and-saffron-refresher-nik-sharma

Cinnamon-Date Sticky Buns,"¾ cup buttermilk or plain whole-milk yogurt, 7 Tbsp. vegetable oil, divided, 1 large egg, ¼ cup (packed; 50 g) dark brown sugar, 1 ¼-oz. envelope active dry yeast (about 2¼ tsp.), 3 cups (375 g) all-purpose flour, ¼ tsp. baking soda, 1 tsp. kosher salt, 1 cup (packed; 180 g) Medjool dates, halved, pitted, 2 tsp. ground cinnamon, ½ tsp. kosher salt, 3 Tbsp. vegetable oil, divided, ¼ cup (packed; 50 g) dark brown sugar, ¾ cup (83 g) powdered sugar, 3 Tbsp. buttermilk or plain whole-milk yogurt, 1 tsp. vanilla paste or extract","Title: Cinnamon-Date Sticky Buns
Instructions: Combine buttermilk and 6 Tbsp. oil in a small microwave-safe bowl (it won’t get smooth and that’s okay) and heat in the microwave in three 10-second bursts until just about body temperature (it shouldn’t feel hot or cold to the touch); an instant-read thermometer will register about 98°F. (Alternatively, you can heat in a small saucepan over medium-low, stirring constantly, about 1 minute.)
Whisk egg, brown sugar, and yeast in a liquid measuring cup to combine, then whisk into buttermilk mixture.
Pulse flour, baking soda, and salt in a food processor to combine. With the motor running, stream in buttermilk mixture. Process until about 80% of the dough comes together into a ball (mixture will look very wet at first, then begin to pull away from the sides of processor), about 2 minutes.
Using a bowl scraper or rubber spatula, scrape dough onto an unfloured surface. (It should still be pretty wet and sticky.) Knead, pushing it away from you, then pulling it back toward you, until a smooth ball forms, about 3 minutes. The dough will grow silkier, tighter, and easier to work with as you knead.
Roll out dough into a rough 8"" square. Fold dough over onto itself to make an 8x4"" rectangle, then flatten it slightly and fold over once more to make a 4"" square. Roll dough back out to an 8"" square and repeat folding process (you should be back at a 4"" square). Pour remaining 1 Tbsp. oil into a medium bowl and add dough (still folded); turn to coat. Cover bowl tightly and chill dough until doubled in volume, at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.
Place dates in a small bowl and pour in 1½ cups hot water to cover. Let soak until softened, about 10 minutes.
Drain dates and transfer to a food processor; discard soaking liquid. Add cinnamon, salt, and 2 Tbsp. oil. Purée, scraping down sides as needed, until smooth, about 4 minutes. (You should have about ½ cup purée.)
Grease a 10"" cast-iron skillet with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil. Transfer dough to a clean, unfloured surface and roll out to an 8"" square. Fold in half into an 8x4"" rectangle, then fold rectangle over itself to form a 4"" square (same folding process as you did before). If dough feels tough and uncooperative, let it sit about 5 minutes to relax and try again. Roll out dough to a 12"" square about ¼"" thick. Dollop date purée all over. Using a small offset spatula, spread evenly over dough, leaving a ½"" border without purée along edge farthest from you. Sprinkle brown sugar over purée.
Starting at edge closest to you, roll up dough into a tight log. Using a sharp serrated knife and long sawing motions, trim about ½"" of dough from both ends and discard. Slice log crosswise into 3 sections, wiping knife clean between slices. Slice each section crosswise into 3 buns (you should have 9 buns total that are each about 1"" thick). Transfer buns to prepared pan as you go.
Cover pan tightly with foil (or a domed lid if you have one) and place in a warm, dry spot. Let buns rise until they’re doubled in volume and spring back when poked, leaving only a small indentation, 1–1½ hours, depending on how warm and humid your kitchen is.
Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Bake buns, still covered, until puffed, pale, and mostly set, about 20 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes if you prefer a soft and squishy bun and up to 25 minutes for a more toasted bun. Let cool slightly.
Meanwhile, whisk powdered sugar, buttermilk, and vanilla in a medium bowl to combine.
Brush glaze over warm buns and serve in skillet.
Do Ahead: Purée can be made 3 days ahead. Place in an airtight container; cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before using.",cinnamon-date-sticky-buns

Instructions: Because agar-agar is seaweed-based and fairly delicate to work with, this recipe might be one you can’t multitask until you get a good feel for it. Handle with care, and let’s hope you don’t have to frustratingly do it over and over again.
Heat water and salted plum powder in pot over medium heat. When it starts to steam (not boil!), add lime juice and agar-agar. Whisk until agar-agar dissolves. Continue to whisk for 1 minute, or until the mixture thickens. Remove from heat and pour in a container, then let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate to settle. Once it settles, add to a blender and puree until it forms a thicker saucy consistency. Store in fridge until you’re ready to bust that bad boy out!
If using gelatin sheets, add to a bowl of ice-cold water and submerge. Soak (aka let the gelatin bloom) for 5–7 minutes, or until the sheets soften. To prevent sheets from breaking down, drain water immediately after the 5–7 minutes and gently wring out remaining water from the sheets, just like you were wringing out a towel.
If using powdered gelatin, place gelatin in a bowl and add 1/3 cup heavy cream. Let it sit. Let it bloom.
If using a fun mold to shape and pop out your panna cotta, brush a light layer of cooking oil on the bottom and sides.
Next, drain syrup from can of lychee (or save for a lychee-flavored cocktail or anything else that could use an “infused” sugary syrup, yuuuuummers!). Add lychees to a blender and puree until smooth. Set aside.
This next step is very delicate because gelatin in any form is fairly unstable, so this may take some trial and error, based on a balance of your heat and your feel for that heat. You’ll know what I mean if you mess up. If you don’t, you’re a natural-born talent!
Heat a pot with milk, sugar, and remaining heavy cream on medium-low heat until sugar dissolves and liquid is warm enough to touch. Like the Salted Plum Sauce, the milk, sugar, and heavy cream should steam but not boil. If you have a thermometer, DO NOT go over 145°F.
Next, add gelatin (sheets or powdered in heavy cream), then whisk until gelatin dissolves. This will take a few minutes.
Remove from heat, then immediately add lychee puree while the cream is still warm. Mix gently with a spatula.
Ladle into ramekins, small bowls, your preferred fancy or not-so-fancy container, or into your pre-oil-brushed mold.
Refrigerate, carefully. Gelatin is fairly docile and irritably unstable. As it cools, however, panna cotta should solidify within an hour.
If after 2 hours it still hasn’t settled, don’t fret—you can still recover. Recombine the cream in a pot and warm to right below boiling. Add a tad bit more (bloomed) gelatin, then remove from heat. Repour into molds. Be careful not to add too much gelatin, which will result in a stiff, less creamy panna cotta, more of a superstiff Jell-O than panna cotta.
Garnish with a thin layer of Salted Plum Sauce on top of your final plating—do fancy dots or a paintbrush swipe if you would like—and edible flowers (if you somehow got these) and pomegranate seeds (if in season and available). Bon appetit, y’all.",salted-plum-lychee-panna-cotta

Instructions: To make the salsa verde: Put the tomatillos, chile, onion, and garlic in a medium pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the vegetables are soft and the tomatillos turn pale green, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.
Carefully transfer the boiled vegetables, along with the cooking water, to a blender. Puree for a few seconds to blend; be sure to hold down the lid with a kitchen towel for safety. Add the 1/2 bay leaf, oregano, thyme, salt, and broth. Continue to puree until smooth. You should have about 1 quart of salsa verde.
Place a wide pot or pan over medium-high heat and coat with the corn oil. When the oil is hazy, pour in the salsa verde; it will bubble a bit. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is slightly thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Cover, reduce the heat to very low, and keep warm while you finish the chips.
Pour the vegetable oil into a heavy-bottomed pot or countertop deep fryer to a depth of about 2 inches and heat to 375°F over medium-high heat. Stack the tortillas and fan them with your thumb to separate. Cut the tortillas into 8 wedges like a pie.
Working in batches, fry the tortilla chips, turning them with a skimmer or slotted spoon so they don't stick together, until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.

Salted Caramel Risotto,"1/2 tablespoon (7 g) unsalted butter, 1/2 cup (100 g) short-grain white rice, such as arborio, 1 cup (240 ml) whole milk, 1 cup (200 g) sugar, 1 cup (240 ml) cream, 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, Unsweetened whipped cream, to serve","Title: Salted Caramel Risotto
Instructions: Toast the rice: Heat 2 cups (480 ml) water. Melt the butter in a heavy 3-quart (2.8-L) pan over medium-high heat. When the butter foams up, add the rice and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring until it is translucent and golden.
Cook the rice: Pour in the milk and the hot water. Bring to a boil, then lower to a steady simmer and cook, stirring frequently, for 15 minutes, or until the rice grains have softened and are al dente (completely cooked through but still with some chewiness).
Make the caramel: While the rice is cooking, mix the sugar and 1/4 cup (60 ml) water in a 4-quart (3.8-L) or larger heavy pot with tall sides. Cook over high heat, stirring, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a boil. Stop stirring and watch the syrup; when light golden streaks appear, carefully swirl the pot to help the sugar caramelize evenly. Continue boiling until the mixture turns a dark amber color. The sugar will begin to smoke; this is normal.
When the caramel has been smoking for about 15 seconds, pull the pan off the heat and carefully add the cream in a slow stream, whisking constantly. Be careful, as hot steam will bubble up furiously. Whisk this mixture until smoothly combined. (If the caramel seizes and becomes a solid mass when the cream is added, return the pan to low heat and continue whisking until it is melted and smooth. You can minimize the chance of seizing by heating the cream prior to pouring it in.)
Sweeten the rice: Add the rice to the caramel, stirring well. Simmer over medium-low heat, for 15 to 20 minutes, until much of the liquid has evaporated. Stir frequently to keep the rice from scorching.
The liquid will reduce and get darker, and the rice will soften a little more. The pudding will look soupy and thin, but it will thicken considerably as it cools. Stir in the vanilla and salt. Transfer to a container and refrigerate until the pudding is at your desired consistency and temperature—about 30 minutes for a warm pudding, and 2 hours for a cold pudding. (If the cold pudding is too firm, thin with a little whole milk.) Serve warm with unsweetened whipped cream.",salted-caramel-risotto-51176400

Instructions: 1. First make the crust: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sage, and salt until well combined. Sprinkle the butter cubes over the flour mixture and use your fingers to work them in (you want to rub your thumb against your fingertips, smearing the butter as you do so). Do this until the mixture looks like cornmeal with some pea-sized bits of butter remaining. Stir in the cheese with a fork until evenly distributed. Sprinkle 6 tablespoons ice water over the mixture and stir with a fork until the dough begins to come together. If needed, add an additional tablespoon or two of ice water (you shouldn't need much more). Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead three times. Gather the dough into a ball, then divide into two portions, making one slightly bigger than the other. Press each portion down into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
2. Make the filling: In a skillet over medium-low heat, cook the apples without any oil, stirring gently, until they just begin to soften, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a dish and set aside. Add oil to the pan and increase the heat to medium-high. Add the onion, pork, brown sugar, salt, and spices. Cook, using a wooden spoon to break up the meat, until it is lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Let the meat mixture cool for 10 minutes, then transfer to a food processor. Add the breadcrumbs and pulse five times until the mixture has the texture of coarse sand. Set aside.
3. Prepare the crust: Unwrap the larger disk of dough and put it in the center of a large sheet of parchment paper or wax paper. Cover the dough with a second piece of parchment. Roll out, working from the center, to a 13-inch circle. Peel off the top piece of parchment and transfer the dough to a pie plate, peeled side down. Peel off the remaining parchment and press the crust into the sides of the pie plate, draping any excess over the edge. Unwrap the smaller disk of dough and put it in the center of a large sheet of parchment paper. Cover the dough with a second piece of parchment. Roll out, working from the center, to an 11-inch circle. Set aside.
4. Preheat the oven to 425°F and set a rack to the second-to-bottom position. Fill the pie: Pour the meat mixture into the bottom crust and gently smooth the top with a spatula. Arrange the cooked apple slices over the meat, pressing down to make the whole construction as smooth and neat as possible. Peel the top sheet of parchment off the top crust. Transfer, peeled side down, to the pie, then peel off the remaining parchment. Using a sharp knife, make two 3-inch slashes in the crust to allow steam to escape. Fold the edges of the bottom crust up over the top crust and crimp the edges to seal. Brush the crust with the egg wash and decorate with sage leaves, if desired. Bake at 425°F for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375°F and bake until the crust is golden brown, 25 to 35 minutes more.

Instructions: Place sugar in a deep, heavy saucepan set over medium heat. Stir continuously and break up any lumps of sugar—this will help the sugar caramelize evenly. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring with a spatula to dissolve the sugar, then simmer, without stirring, until the caramel turns the color of a copper penny (or an Irish setter), about 4 minutes. If, while the caramel cooks, any sugar crystallizes on the sides of the pan, brush down the sides with a clean, wet pastry brush. Reduce the heat to low, and slowly add 1/2 cup of the cream (the caramel will rise and bubble and might spit, so be careful). Stir until the cream is well incorporated into the caramel. Remove from the heat and stir in salt. Should the caramel seize and harden, return the mixture to the heat and stir until it softens. Remove from heat and set aside.
Prepare an ice bath in a large bowl and set another bowl over it. Set aside.Pour the milk and remaining 1 1/2 cups cream into a double boiler or a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (the bottom of the bowl should not touch the water). Add the vanilla bean seeds and pod and warm the mixture until you see steam rising from the top.Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, with a kitchen towel underneath it to prevent slipping, whisk together the egg yolks until uniform. While whisking, add a splash of the hot dairy mixture to the yolks. Continue to add the dairy mixture, whisking it in bit by bit, until you’ve added about half. Add the yolk mixture to the remaining dairy mixture in the double boiler, and stir in the caramel. Set the heat under the double boiler to medium and cook the custard, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon and reducing the heat to medium-low as necessary, until steam begins to rise from the surface and the custard thickens enough to coat the back of the spoon. Hold the spoon horizontally and run your finger through the custard. If the trail left by your finger stays separated, the custard is ready to be cooled.Strain the custard into the bowl sitting over the prepared ice bath and stir for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the custard has cooled. Transfer the custard to a quart-sized container, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or, preferably, overnight.Pour the chilled custard into an ice cream maker, add the salted caramel, and freeze according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Place the container in which you refrigerated the custard in the freezer so you can use it to store the finished ice cream. Churn the ice cream until the texture resembles “soft serve.” Transfer the ice cream to the chilled storage container and freeze until hardened to your desired consistency.

Buckwheat Crepes with Honeyed Ricotta and Sautéed Plums,"1/2 cup / 65 g buckwheat flour, 1/2 cup / 60 g unbleached all-purpose flour, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 1 cup / 240 ml milk, 3/4 cup / 180 ml buttermilk, 2 tablespoons butter, melted, plus more for greasing the pan, 2 large eggs, 1 tablespoons coconut oil or butter, 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, 1 tablespoon honey, 1 pound / 450 g Italian plums (6 to 7 plums), each sliced into 6 wedges, Honeyed Ricotta, Honey, for serving","Title: Buckwheat Crepes with Honeyed Ricotta and Sautéed Plums
Instructions: To make the crepes: Whisk the flours, salt, milk, buttermilk, butter, and eggs together in a large bowl until very smooth. To save arm power, you can blend the ingredients in a blender instead. Let the batter sit for at least 1 hour at room temperature and up to 1 day in the refrigerator.
Rub a small dab of butter (1/2 tablespoon or so) onto the bottom of a 9- or 10-inch nonstick crepe pan or sauté pan over medium heat and wait until it melts completely. (Too much butter will make for a soggy crepe.) Pour 1/4 cup of the batter into the hot pan and tilt it in a circular motion to ensure the batter spreads out into an even layer. Cook over low heat until the edges start to pull away from the pan, about 2 minutes. Using a nonstick spatula, carefully flip and cook the other side until golden brown, about 1 minute. Lay the crepe on a large plate and repeat until you've gone through all of the batter (it's okay to stack the crepes on the plate). If the crepe pan starts to get too dry, add another little dab of butter. I tend to cook these quickly while the plums are sautéing and assemble them right then, but if you're chatting with friends and taking your time, keep the finished, unfilled crepes warm in a 200°F oven until ready to assemble.
To sauté the plums: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the coconut oil. Add the vanilla and honey, swirl the pan so they combine with the coconut oil, and then add the plums. Sauté until juicy and warm, 2 to 3 minutes.
To assemble: For each crepe, gently fold the crepe in fourths (fold in half, then in half again) and dollop 1 to 2 tablespoons of the Honeyed Ricotta and a few sautéed plums on top. Finish with a generous drizzle of honey.
Make Ahead: You can cook the crepes and store them in the refrigerator, stacked between pieces of waxed or parchment paper, for up to 3 days. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months by allowing the crepes to cool completely, wrapping them well in plastic wrap, and placing them in an airtight container. To reheat, place them in a glass baking dish or a pie plate covered with aluminum foil. Heat in a 250°F oven until just warmed through.",buckwheat-crepes-with-honeyed-ricotta-and-sauteed-plums-51195420

Zuni Ricotta Gnocchi,"1 pound fresh ricotta (2 cups), 2 large cold eggs, lightly beaten, 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, 2 or 3 fresh sage leaves, chopped, or a few pinches of freshly grated nutmeg, or a few pinches freshly chopped lemon zest (all optional), 1/2 ounce Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated (about 1/4 cup very lightly packed), About 1/4 teaspoon salt (a little more if using kosher salt), All-purpose flour, for forming the gnocchi, 8 tablespoons butter, sliced, 2 teaspoons water","Title: Zuni Ricotta Gnocchi
Instructions: Check the cheese for wetness. If you are lucky enough to have an individual basket-drained ricotta—you'll see the basket imprint or dimples on the cheese—it may be sitting in a little whey; in this case, slide it out of the container and wick away the surface moisture with a dry towel. With any ricotta, place about 2 teaspoons of the cheese on a dry paper towel and wait for about 1 minute. There will always be a little wet spot under and around the cheese, but if the cheese has thrown a wide ring of moisture, it is too wet to use as is. Place it in a strainer, or double-wrap in cheesecloth, and suspend over a deeper receptacle to drain for 8 to 24 hours, refrigerated. Cheesecloth is more efficient, as it also wicks moisture from the cheese while gravity does its job of draining. You can also speed up the draining operation by cinching the cheesecloth tight and squeezing some of the moisture from the ball of cheese.
Beat the ricotta vigorously, then smash a little cheese against the side of the bowl with a soft rubber spatula. If you can still make out firm curds, press the cheese through a strainer to break them up. Stir in the eggs. Melt the 1 tablespoon of butter—with the chopped sage, if using—and add to the batter. Add the nutmeg or lemon zest, if using. Add the Parmigiano and salt and beat the whole mixture very well. This is what makes the gnocchi light. You should have a soft, fluffy batter.
Make a bed of flour about 1/2 inch deep in a shallow baking dish or on a sheet pan.
Scrape the sides of the bowl, mass the batter, and smooth its surface. Use a spoon held at an angle to shallow-scoop out 2 to 3 teaspoons of batter. Use your fingertip to push the almond-shaped scoop of batter cleanly from the bowl of the spoon onto the bed of flour. Shimmy the pan gently to coat the sides, then flip the gnocchi with your fingertip to coat the top. Lift from the flour and cradle and rock it in your palm. Don't squeeze it. You should have a dusty oval pod. As long as the general shape is uniform and rotund, don't worry that the gnocchi has a few wrinkles, dimples, and bumps.
To check the batter, poach this first gnocchi in a small pot of simmering well-salted water. It will initially sink, but will then swell, roll, and bob to the surface. Maintaining the quiet simmer, cook until the gnocchi is just firm, usually 3 to 5 minutes from the time it floats, depending on the cheese and the size of the gnocchi. Don't boil hard, or the gnocchi may explode. If, even at a gentle simmer, the gnocchi spreads or starts to decompose, the cheese was probably too wet. This can usually be corrected by beating a teaspoon or so of egg white into the remaining batter. If the batter was very fluffy[,-CUT] but the sample seems heavy, beat in about 1 teaspoon beaten egg. In either case, poach another sample to make sure the fix is successful.
Taste the sample for salt, and adjust the batter if needed.
Use the same spoon-and-finger technique to form the rest of the gnocchi. I usually form them in groups of 4 to 6, placing them all at the same angle, and a few inches apart, in the bed of flour, then shimmy the pan to coat all of them at once; don't leave them sitting too long in the flour, or they will absorb too much. Keep scraping the bowl and smoothing the surface of the batter to permit smooth scoops. As with the sample, roll each gnocchi in your hand. Arrange them on a sheet pan lined with a flour-dusted sheet of parchment paper or wax paper. Be sure that the individual gnocchi are not touching one another.
You can poach the gnocchi right away, but if you refrigerate them uncovered for about an hour, they will firm up, making them easier to cook and handle. (They will keep for up to 8 hours that way.)
Place the 8 tablespoons of butter and the 2 teaspoons of water in a 12-inch skillet; set aside.
Bring 2 to 3 quarts water to a simmer in a wide pan, 10 or more inches in diameter, so the gnocchi won't crush each other too much as they push to the surface. A sauté pan, flared brasier, or saucier pan will work, as long as it is at least 2 inches deep. Salt the water liberally—about 1 teaspoon per quart. Add the gnocchi one by one, adjusting the heat to maintain the simmer. Dip your fingertips in water if you find they are sticking to the gnocchi, but don't fret if the gnocchi stick a little to the paper. Do avoid holding the tray of gnocchi in the steam. Cook the gnocchi as you did the sample, until just firm, 3 to 5 minutes from the time they float.
Meanwhile, as soon as the gnocchi float to the surface, place the pan of butter and water over medium heat. Swirl the pan as the butter melts and begins to seethe. As soon as the butter is completely melted and has turned into an opaque pale yellow sauce, turn off the heat. Swirl the pan a few more times.
Lift the gnocchi out with a slotted spoon or skimmer, slide into the ready skillet, and roll in the warm butter sauce. Serve instantly in warm bowls.
The mild flavor of the ricotta marries well with many other flavors and ingredients, especially sweet, subtle, or nutty ones. Whatever the companion, it should be tender and delicate—like the gnocchi themselves.
Try serving the dumplings with a few leaves of sage, arugula, or spinach wilted in butter, or roll in melted butter with just-cooked baby carrots and fresh chervil. Or pair with tender flageolets finished with extra-virgin olive oil and black pepper. Or fold in matchsticks of just-cooked zucchini; its subtle flavor becomes clearer next to these gnocchi. In the spring, we offer them with barely cooked peas, tiny favas, or finely slivered asparagus, or all three. During summer, we match them with fresh white corn kernels cooked in butter with basil, or scatter them with chopped nasturtium blossoms. When tender-skinned Sungold Sweet 100 tomatoes are at their sweetest, we halve them, warm them in extra-virgin olive oil with basil, and toss them over the gnocchi. In the fall, fresh wild mushrooms slivered, stewed, and finished with white truffle oil are delicious with the gnocchi, and in the winter, whenever we have black truffles in house, we shave some generously over the dish.
Prepare the batter as above. Warm an additional tablespoon of butter in a 10-inch skillet over low heat. Add a few handfuls of spinach leaves—about 2 ounces. Salt lightly and, stirring and folding constantly, cook until the spinach is completely wilted but still vibrant green, 1 to 2 minutes. Slide onto a clean towel, cover with another towel, and press to extract the moisture. (The spinach will bleed green into the towel.) Peel off the spinach and chop into bits the size of fresh thyme leaves. Don't chop fine, and don't purée, or you will sacrifice the nice texture and burst of flavor it promises.

Trout with Haricots Verts and Almonds,"Four 10-ounce boned whole rainbow trout, 8 ounces haricots verts, stem ends removed, Kosher salt and freshly ground white pepper, Canola oil, 10 tablespoons (5 ounces) unsalted butter, 3/4 cup sliced blanched (skinned) almonds, lightly toasted, 2 teaspoons minced Italian parsley, 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice","Title: Trout with Haricots Verts and Almonds
Instructions: With scissors, cut away the dorsal fin along the back of each fish. Hold each pectoral fin (the one closest to the head) and cut away and discard the gill plate and pectoral fin. Turn the fish on its back and open it up. Starting at the head, cut away the belly flap on each side, along with the pelvic fin. Remove the tail by cutting across the fish about an inch from the bottom of the tail. Set aside.
Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Prepare an ice bath. Blanch the haricots verts in the boiling water for 2 to 6 minutes, or until they are barely tender, with a slight bite still left to them. Drain the beans and transfer to the ice bath to chill quickly, then drain again and dry on paper towels.
Lightly sprinkle both sides of each trout with salt and pepper. If you have them, heat two 12-inch nonstick pans (special oval pans work best for fish) over medium-high heat. If you have only one pan, cook two trout first, cover, and keep them in a warm place while you cook the final two. Coat each pan with a light film of canola oil. Add the trout skin side down and sauté for about 4 minutes on one side only. The fish may still look undercooked at the top of the flesh, but the hot ingredients that will top them will complete the cooking.
Meanwhile, put the beans in a sauté pan, add 2 tablespoons of the butter and 1/3 cup water, and place over medium heat. Heat, stirring occasionally, until the water has evaporated and the beans are hot and glazed with butter. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.
When the fish are done, cut off the heads and discard, if desired, and place the fish on serving plates. Drain the oil from one of the pans and return the pan to the heat. Add the remaining 8 tablespoons butter and a pinch of salt to the hot pan. When the butter begins to brown, add the almonds, shaking the pan to brown them evenly. When they are a rich golden brown, add the parsley and lemon juice.
Meanwhile, cover each trout with one-quarter of the beans.

Instructions: Place the zest strips in a small saucepan and cover with water. Bring the water to a boil, then drain. Repeat this process two more times (blanching the orange zest removes any bitter flavors). Place the ginger and orange zest in a jar or heatproof container. In a saucepan, bring the lime juice, vinegar, sugar, and ¾ teaspoon salt to a boil. Pour over the ginger and orange. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate overnight. The pickled ginger can be refrigerated for a couple of months.
Drain the pickled ginger and orange and save 3 tablespoons of the pickling liquid. Add both to a blender or mini food processor, along with the olive oil, chile, and remaining 2 tablespoons salt. Blend until very smooth, scraping down the side of the blender as needed. Transfer to a container and refrigerate until ready to use. The puree can be made a couple of days ahead. (Makes about 1 cup.)
Preheat the oven to 375°F. Place the beets in a baking dish (if using a mix of red and golden beets, separate them into two smaller dishes and divide the oil, vinegar, and water between the two dishes). Drizzle with the oil and add the water and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Cover the pan with foil and roast until the beets are tender when pierced with a knife; this can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the thickness of the beets. Let the beets cool, then peel and cut into 1-inch wedges. Place each color of beet, along with any accumulated juices, into a small mixing bowl.
In a skillet, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add the cashews and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown. Transfer to a heat-proof bowl.
Pour 1 inch of oil into a small saucepan and add the sunchokes (there should be just enough oil to cover the sunchokes; add more oil if needed). Turn the heat to medium and stir occasionally; when the sunchokes begin to sizzle and foam, increase the temperature to high and continue frying, stirring constantly, until the sunchokes are light golden brown. At this point the sunchokes will rapidly go from golden brown to burnt, so quickly transfer the chips to paper towels to drain. Lightly season with salt. The sunchoke chips can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for a day or two, or until they start to soften. (Makes about ½ cup.)
Using a sharp knife, cut the peel and pith off the orange. Working over a bowl, cut the orange between the membranes to release the segments. Dice the segments, then return them to the bowl.

Planked Beef Fillets with Porcini Slather,"1/4 ounce dried porcini mushrooms, ground to a powder in a coffee grinder, 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 2 tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon kosher salt, 1/2 tablespoon red pepper flakes, 1/2 tablespoon coarse cracked black pepper, 6 cloves garlic, minced, Four 5- to 6-ounce beef tenderloin steaks, cut 3/4 inch thick","Title: Planked Beef Fillets with Porcini Slather
Instructions: 1. To make the slather, combine all the ingredients in a small bowl and stir to blend well.
2. Prepare an indirect fire in your grill, with a hot fire on one side and no fire on the other. For a charcoal grill, soak 1 cup wood chips in water for at least 30 minutes and place directly on the hot coals when ready to plank. For a gas grill, place 1/2 cup dry wood chips in a smoker box (or wrap chips in aluminum foil and poke holes in the foil) and place over direct heat in the back of the grill.
3. Sear the steaks over the hot fire for 3 or 4 minutes on one side, and then place the steaks on the plank, uncooked side down. Top each fillet with about 1 tablespoon of the slather.
4. Place the plank on the indirect side of the grill. Close the lid and cook until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the steak registers 130°F for medium-rare, about 20 minutes.
Oven-Smoke Planking: Preheat the oven to 400°F. Place 1/2 cup dry wood chips in a small metal pan on the bottom rack of the oven and let smolder for about 15 minutes before planking. Meanwhile, in a medium-hot skillet, sear the tenderloin on all sides. When the smoke begins to fill the oven, place the seared steaks on the plank in the middle of the oven. Oven-plank for 20 minutes, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the steak registers about 130°F for medium-rare.",planked-beef-fillets-with-porcini-slather-359610
Carciofi alla Giudea,"3 lemons, divided, 12 baby artichokes, Olive oil (for frying)","Title: Carciofi alla Giudea
Instructions: Cut 1 lemon in half. Squeeze juice into large bowl; add lemon halves. Fill bowl 2/3 full with water. Working with 1 artichoke at a time, break off dark outer leaves until only pale green leaves remain. Trim end off stem and cut 1/2 inch off top of artichoke; add to lemon water. Repeat with remaining artichokes.
Fill another large bowl with ice water. Blanch artichokes in large saucepan of boiling salted water 10 seconds; transfer to ice water to cool completely. Remove artichokes from water and shake off excess moisture. Gently pry open leaves and press as flat as possible. Invert artichokes onto paper-towel-lined work surface and press to hold leaves open. Drain 30 minutes. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover with plastic and let stand at room temperature.)

Asparagus Velouté,"2 pounds (1 kg.) white asparagus, 1 quart (1 L.) chicken stock (or store-bought), or chicken broth (or store-bought or made from a bouillon cube), A bit of sugar (1 cube if you have cubes), 5 cup (30 g.) cornstarch, 1 egg yolk, 1 cup (25 cl.) heavy cream, Salt","Title: Asparagus Velouté
Instructions: 1. Wash the asparagus. Cut 2 inches (5 cm.) off the tips and save them for another use. Do not peel the stalks but cut them into 15-inch (3-cm.) pieces.
2. Bring the stock or broth to a boil in a soup pot. When it bubbles, add the asparagus pieces and sugar. Turn down the heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
3. Blend and pass through a fine strainer (a chinois if possible), pressing on the solids with a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Put the soup back in the pot, bring back to a boil, and boil about 30 minutes more.
4. Thoroughly mix the cornstarch in a bowl with 1 tablespoon cold water. Beat the yolk and cream together in a bowl large enough to hold all the soup.
5. When the soup in the pot has been reduced by about half, whisk in the cornstarch mixture. Boil for 1 minute, whisking constantly, and then gently pour everything into the bowl with the egg-cream mixture, whisking as you pour.
6. Pour the contents of the bowl back into the soup pot and heat very gently in order to thicken. Stir with a spatula and turn off the heat at the first sign of boiling. Blend. Season with salt as necessary.",asparagus-veloute-355936
Quick Condensed Milk,"4 cups (32 ounces) milk (any percentage will do), 3/4 cup (6 ounces) heavy cream, 1 cup (7 ounces) sugar, 1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)","Title: Quick Condensed Milk
Instructions: Combine milk, cream, sugar, and salt in a 5-quart stainless steel saucier. If using a scale, weigh the pot and ingredients together so you can digitally track the reduction. Place over medium heat, stirring occasionally with a heat resistant spatula, until the milk begins to simmer, about 12 minutes. Continue cooking another 30 minutes more, scraping continuously to prevent a milky buildup from forming around the sides. When the thickened milk-syrup suddenly begins to foam, it’s almost done. Keep simmering and stirring until the foam subsides and the dairy has condensed to exactly 2 cups or 19 ounces. If using a scale, the pot will weigh 26 ounces less than when you started.
Pour into an airtight container, seal to prevent evaporation, and refrigerate up to 1 month. To mimic the consistency of canned milk, bring to room temperature before using.
Even slightly acidic ingredients will cause hot dairy to curdle, including raw cane sugar, brown sugar, coconut sugar, maple syrup, honey, and agave. Take care when experimenting with ingredients not listed in the variations.
Chai Spice: Along with the sugar, add two 4-inch cinnamon sticks, 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds, 1/2 teaspoon whole allspice berries, 10 whole black peppercorns, 5 whole cloves, and 6 white cardamom pods, gently cracked. Proceed as directed. For an easy chai latte, stir 1 tablespoon of the spiced milk into 6 ounces (3/4 cup) hot black tea, such as Assam.
Dulce de Leche: This rich and nutty variation owes its caramel flavor and color to baking soda, which raises the dairy’s pH, allowing the lactose to brown at lower temperatures than normal. Add 1/2 teaspoon baking soda to the sugar and proceed as directed; though the mixture will foam more vigorously, there is no risk of overflow. Made with goat’s milk in the variation below, dulce de leche is known as cajeta. As the browning process will resume with continued exposure to heat, neither dulce de leche or cajeta can be used as an ingredient in baked goods.
Fresh Ginger: Peel and roughly chop a 2-inch piece of fresh ginger; add along with the sugar.
Goat's-Milk: This variation is more easily digested by those with lactose intolerance, and because goat’s milk won’t curdle when it’s boiled, there’s no need for cream. Trust me, there’s nothing “goaty” about it—just gentle creaminess anyone can enjoy. Replace milk and cream with 38 ounces (4 3/4 cups) goat’s milk and proceed as directed. Note: This variation requires “ultra-high temperature” pasteurized goat’s milk, as raw or low-heat pasteurized versions may turn grainy with prolonged cooking.
Lavender: During the cooking process, lavender mellows into something soft and aromatic, without any hint of the soapiness that can so often be its downfall. Add 1 tablespoon dried lavender buds along with the sugar.
Rosemary: Wonderfully herbaceous, this variation is my absolute favorite way to make Pumpkin Pie. Add a 4-inch sprig of fresh rosemary along with the sugar.
Soft-Serve: This eggless ice cream has an unbelievably pure and creamy flavor, with a silkiness that reminds me of Dairy Queen soft serve. Prepare the Quick Condensed Milk or any variation and pour into a large bowl. Add 10 ounces (1 1/4 cups) heavy cream, 2 ounces (1/4 cup) whole milk, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (half as much if iodized), and 1 tablespoon vanilla extract and mix well. Chill until cold, about 2 hours, and churn according to manufacturer directions.
Vanilla Bean: I make this variation whenever I have an empty vanilla bean left over from another project, as the cooking process will extract considerable flavor from even the most withered pod (the sheer volume of seeds in a “fresh” pod can turn the milk gray). Add scraped vanilla pod to the milk and proceed as directed. To deepen the flavor, leave the vanilla pod in the jar of Quick Condensed Milk.",quick-condensed-milk

Yellow Tomatoes Stuffed with Grilled Wild Mushrooms and Parmesan Cheese,"1 cup sliced oyster, shiitake, or portobello mushrooms (domestic or imported), 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon minced shallots, 1/4 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary, 1/4 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, 4 perfectly ripe yellow (or red) medium-size beefsteak tomatoes, 1/4 cup fresh grated Parmesan cheese, 1 handful mixed baby greens, Sweet Shallot Vinaigrette","Title: Yellow Tomatoes Stuffed with Grilled Wild Mushrooms and Parmesan Cheese
Instructions: In a medium bowl, combine the mushrooms with the olive oil, shallots, rosemary, and thyme; let sit for about 10 minutes.
Light a fire in a charcoal or gas grill. Using tongs, remove the mushrooms from the marinade and grill until slightly softened and browned, about 2 minutes on each side. Set them aside. (You can also complete this step ahead of time, refrigerate the mushrooms, and then bring them to room temperature when you're ready to stuff the tomatoes.)
Meanwhile, prepare the tomatoes so that you can use them to serve your salad in. Preheat the oven to 325° F. Using a sharp knife, slice the tops off the tomatoes either flat or in a zigzag pattern; you need them later so don't discard them. Using a melon baller or spoon, scoop out the insides. (You may want to save the insides for a sauce or another salad.) Set aside. Place the tomatoes into a 1-inch baking pan (you may have to adjust the bottoms—cutting carefully and only slightly—if they can't sit upright), with their tops. Bake until the skins start to wrinkle, about 15 minutes.
When the tomatoes are finished, remove the tops and stuff with alternate layers of the mushroom mixture and the cheese. Place the tomatoes back into the oven (without the tops) just until the cheese starts to melt, about 5 minutes.
Top each tomato with a bit of the mixed baby greens and a drizzle of the vinaigrette. Cover with the tomato tops, and serve.",yellow-tomatoes-stuffed-with-grilled-wild-mushrooms-and-parmesan-cheese-358969

Seared Scallops With Pan Sauce,"3 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 1/2 pounds sea scallops, Salt and freshly ground pepper, 1 tablespoon minced garlic, Juice of 1 lemon, 1/2 cup dry white wine or water, or more as needed, 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives","Title: Seared Scallops With Pan Sauce
Instructions: Cut 2 tablespoons of the butter into pea-sized pieces, put it on a small plate, and stick it in the freezer. Heat a large skillet over medium-heat high for 3 or 4 minutes. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and the olive oil and wait for the butter to melt.
Pat the scallops dry with paper towels, add them to the pan and sprinkle with salt and pepper; work in batches if necessary to avoid crowding the skillet. Cook, turning once, until they are well browned on both sides but not quite cooked through, 2 minutes per side (less if the scallops are under 1 inch across; more if they’re over). Transfer the scallops to a plate.
Stir in the garlic, lemon juice, and wine and scrape all the brown bits off the bottom of the skillet with a spatula. Lower the heat to medium and cook until the liquid in the skillet thickens, a minute or two, then whisk in the butter you chilled in the freezer, one bit at a time, to make a creamy sauce, adding another tablespoon or two of liquid if necessary.
Return the scallops to the skillet and add the chives. Adjust the heat so the sauce bubbles gently and toss to coat the scallops with the sauce. To serve, transfer the scallops to a platter and spoon the sauce over all.
Seared Scallops With Cherry Tomatoes and Basil: Skip the lemon juice. Cut 1 pint cherry tomatoes in half. Add the tomatoes with the garlic and wine and cook until they wrinkle a bit and release their juice, 2 or 3 minutes. Use chopped fresh basil leaves instead of chives.
Releasing From The Pan: The scallops will offer no resistance when they’re ready to turn. Press down gently while the scallops cook to encourage full contact with the pan, then listen for a hiss: That’s moisture heating and evaporating.
Getting A Good Sear: The idea is to brown the scallops well on both sides without overcooking them, so keep the heat as high as you can without creating too much smoke.
Building Sauce With Butter: After you add the liquid and deglaze the pan, the addition of butter develops fantastic creaminess and richness.
Finishing The Dish: As soon as the scallops are cooked through completely and coated with the sauce, remove the pan from the heat; they will continue to cook. Nick-and-peek into one if you need to check for doneness.",seared-scallops-with-pan-sauce

Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350° F with the rack in the middle. Butter a 2-quart shallow baking dish.
Bring 1-inch salted water to a boil in a large saucepan. Meanwhile, wash lamb's-quarters in a large bowl of cold water and drain well. Trim any coarse, woody stems at bottom (don't go crazy with trimming; young lamb's-quarter stems cook up tender and delicious).
Add lamb's-quarters to pot and cook over medium heat, covered, until leaves are wilted and stems are tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the greens in a large sieve or colander and rinse well under cold running water. Drain again, pressing out excess liquid with the back of a large spoon. Coarsely chop greens and transfer to a bowl. Dry saucepan and reserve.
Cook scallions in olive oil with 1/4 teaspoon salt in reserved saucepan over medium heat, stirring, until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Combine scallion mixture with greens in bowl. Reserve saucepan again.
Melt butter in reserved saucepan over medium-low heat and stir in flour. Cook, stirring, 2 minutes, then whisk in milk and bring to a boil, whisking. Reduce heat and simmer sauce, whisking, 2 minutes (it will be thick). Remove from heat and whisk in nutmeg, zest, and salt and pepper to taste.
Mix sauce into greens mixture. If the mixture is too thick, thin with a little additional milk; season with salt and pepper. Spread out mixture in baking dish.
Toss together crumbs, cheeses, and oil until combined well. Sprinkle topping evenly over greens mixture and bake in oven until crumbs are golden and mixture is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
The best way to make coarse fresh breadcrumbs is to cube fresh bread, then grind it in small batches in a blender (a food processor is not as good at grinding crusty bread into breadcrumbs because the crusts get stuck in the blade).

Stir in 1/2 cup milk and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally to keep grits from sticking to bottom of pan, 10 minutes. Stir in remaining 1/2 cup milk and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until liquid is absorbed and grits are thick and tender, about 35 minutes more. (Grits will have a soft, mashed-potato-like consistency.)
Stir in pepper and remaining tablespoon butter.
